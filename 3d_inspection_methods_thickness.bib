	abstract = {This study evaluates a series of additively manufactured geometric feature build plates to baseline variations and process capability between multiple Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) machine configurations. The geometric feature build plate has dimensions of 140 mm in X-orientation, 140 mm in Y-orientation, and 31.8 mm in Z-height. Geometric features incorporated include but are not limited to X- and Y-distances; varying angle walls; horizontal holes; and vertical features including round holes, concentric hollow cylinders, protruding cylinders, square channels, thin wall thicknesses, freeform surface, and slots. Select features are based on standardized ISO/ASTM test artifact geometry. Additional features were included that are of interest for various aerospace or industrial applications and to understand practical limitations of various machine configurations. All the features are designed and located to be visually and geometrically accessible for inspection without removal from the base plate and to have high probability for successful printing among L-PBF platforms. Features from each of the 16 build plates were measured using optical and mechanical measurement methods and data compiled for a detailed evaluation of each feature. The systematic error for build accuracy across all features was 23.8 ± 5.5 µm with a 99.9% confidence interval. © 2021},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in semiconductor three-dimensional (3D) packaging ignited the need for higher-precision surface metrology, especially for hybrid bonding. This study addresses the technological strength of white-light scanning interferometry (WSI) over atomic force microscopy (AFM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) for nano-meter-resolution hybrid bonding surface measurements/inspections. Two exemplary hybrid bonding samples were prepared for this comparative test with different chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) treatments – one maintaining a metallic tantalum thin-film and the other having an over-polished lower dielectric Tetraethyl Orthosilicate (TEOS) layer without tantalum thin-film, mimicking the copper protrusion. The same samples were measured by WSI and CLSM; the results were compared with the contact-type AFM measurement, the golden standard method in the industry. WSI reconstructed the surface profile similarly to the AFM and showed sub-nm repeatability with a standard deviation of 0.79 nm after 20 consecutive measurements, further supported by the Allan deviation analysis, proving that the system is not affected by non-stationary noise. Interestingly, the existence of a thin film does not affect the stability of the WSI system. CLSM could not appropriately reconstruct the surface profile, and repeatability was also evaluated to be lower than that of WSI. With the proper knowledge of the TEOS and Silicon Nitride thickness, through precision calculation of the phase spectrum change in Cu and Silicon Nitride, we can reconstruct the surface profile with high precision. Theoretical analysis and Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulation were also conducted for in-depth understanding about phase change effect on hybrid bonding sample. Based on these theories and simulations, the universality and sub-nm level accuracy of optical metrology for various bonding materials were verified. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {With the rise in demand for high aspect ratio hole etching in semiconductor device fabrication, developing efficient inspection methods to detect etching failures is increasingly vital. Such failures can compromise the reliability of electrical connections of contact holes in highly sophisticated 3D semiconductor geometries. In this study, we present a nanoscale inspection technique employing synchrotron-based scanning photoelectron microscopy (SPEM) to assess the electrical connectivity of contact holes. Samples were systematically prepared with an array of contact holes of varying sizes. To simulate etching failure, a residual silicon oxide layer was deliberately left to induce the binding energy shift in photoelectron peak positions due to electrical charging. By obtaining W 4f and Si 2p spectra for the W-filled and W-unfilled structures, respectively, we objectively determined the electrical states of the contact holes. With its focused X-ray beams, SPEM has demonstrated its suitability for investigating the electrical connectivity of individual contact holes at the nanoscale. SPEM possesses the additional capability of non-destructive imaging the thickness of buried insulators inside an individual contact hole. Our results cast potential application of SPEM as a nanoscale inspection methodology for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Inter-scanner variability hinders the direct comparability of multi-site/scanner MRI data for clinical research. The ComBat method is commonly used to reduce the variability based on an empirical Bayes framework1,2, harmonizing the data at the feature level (e.g., region-of-interest measures). However, directly harmonizing the scans at the voxel-level using ComBat has been relatively less explored. In this study, we investigated the performance of the voxel-wise ComBat. Also, going beyond voxels, we proposed a new ComBat approach which operates on a small group of voxels called superpixels3. Method: Eighteen subjects (10 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 8 controls; age: 68.0 [9.3] years; 10 females) participated in this study. For each subject, T1-weighted images were acquired on each of four 3T scanners with different manufacturers or models (i.e., GE, Philips, Siemens-Prisma, Siemens-Trio). After the standard image preprocessing including two-step registration by using the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12)4, the unharmonized scans (Raw data) were aligned in the standard template space. To reduce the computational load for ComBat at the voxel level (Voxel-ComBat), we used a three-dimensional superpixel algorithm3 to parcellate the images into hundreds of superpixels based on the study-specific template, and then the ComBat was applied at the superpixel level (Figure 1). Compared to Voxel-Combat operating on about half million voxels (computation time >>10,000 seconds), this superpixel ComBat (SP-ComBat) operates on only a few hundred superpixels, significantly improving the computation efficiency (computation time < 5 seconds) while maintaining the harmonization performance. The harmonized scans were used to estimate cortical thickness by employing surface-based morphometry5, and the coefficients of variation of thickness measures were calculated to evaluate the harmonization performance. Result: The harmonized data provided similar contrasts across scanners compared to the Raw images in visual inspection (Figure 2) and had comparable distributions of the tissue-specific signal intensity between scanners for both Voxel-ComBat and SP-ComBat (Figure 3). Also, these two methods significantly reduced the inter-scanner variation (both p-values < 0.001) in terms of cortical thickness measures (Figure 4). Conclusion: This study evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of Voxel-ComBat and proposed a new approach, SP-ComBat, to optimize the efficiency of ComBat harmonization at the voxel level. © 2022 the Alzheimer's Association.},

	abstract = {The laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process is strongly influenced by the characteristics of the powder layer, including its thickness and thermal transport properties. This paper investigates in-situ characterization of the powder layer using thermographic inspection. A thermal camera monitors the temperature history of the powder surface immediately after a layer of new powder is deposited by the recoating system. During this process, thermal energy diffuses from the underlying solid part, eventually raising the temperature of the above powder layer. Guided by 1D modeling of this heat-up process, experiments show how the parameterized thermal history can be correlated with powder layer thickness and its thermal conductivity. A neural network, based on the parameterized thermal history, further improves the correlation after training. It is used to predict the part distortion for an unsupported structure. This method detects serious part distortion several layers before the part breaks through the powder layer and interacts with the recoater. This approach can be automated to prevent catastrophic recoater crashes or abrasion of soft wipers and has the potential to monitor local properties of the powder layer in-situ. © 2022 The Authors},

We used practical data collected from the No.3 coal seam of the Yangquan Xinjing Mine in the Qinshui Basin for this study.Using the drill core data,the continuous observation of coal structure in excavated roadways,and the three-dimensional seismic results, we studied the distribution characteristics of soft coal in the coal seams.We analyzed the relationship between the distribution characteristics and other geological parameters,such as CBM occurrence,fracture system,sequence stratigraphic sandstone ratio before and after coal accumulation,and coal seam thickness.We also clarified the primary geological factors controlling tectonic coal development. In addition, we propose that the distribution of tectonic coal is controlled by the ternary coupling of abrupt changes in tectonics, peripheral rocks,and coal seams.On this basis,we extracted six seismic-geological characterization attributes that showed dominant effects on the tectonic coal distribution from the 3D seismic data and interpretation. We constructed a tectonic coal distribution prediction model incorporating multiple attributes using the gray correlation method. We then used this model to predict the distribution of soft coal in the No.3 coal seam in the testing area,and checked for the validity and feasibility of the method through excavation and CBM development well inspection,providing a novel approach for accurately predicting tectonic coal distribution. © 2023 Chinese Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma.

	abstract = {Polymeric thin films represent an emerging industrial area driven by their enormous technological and commercial potential in interdisciplinary sectors such as chemistry, material science, engineering, and physics. The large selection in terms of materials/composites and the wide range of technological solutions that could be used for their fabrication could create confusion for the final user requiring a quantitative characterization of their properties. This analysis could be even more complex in the case of functionalized polymeric films such as the samples reported in this work. Here we present how thin polymer films can be wholly characterized by applying a multiplicity of optical methods. Films were realized by a special liquid one-step process. Moreover, such polymer films were functionalized here for the first time by mesoporous silica nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were added to a polymeric matrix. We show that a full characterization was achieved by employing three different microscope techniques, i.e., scanning electron microscope, digital holography (DH), and space-time DH. Exploiting such a multimodal methodology can be of great benefit for characterizing the functionalized polymeric thin films. In fact, multiple characterization in different conditions was possible. The results reported in terms of morphological information, thickness distribution, three-dimensional (3D) mapping, large field of view, high magnification, and super resolution of the zoomed area offer a good solution for testing materials and obtaining a quantitative characterization and whole inspection in the case of complex polymeric samples.  © 2023 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).},

	abstract = {With the continuous improvement of the requirements for parts of national defense core equipment, castings are developing in the direction of complex structures, such as large wall thickness differences and multi-cross structures, which make it more difficult to detect internal defects in castings. In the process of X-ray flaw detection, filming relies on manual adjustment of imaging parts and parameters. There are problems such as easy missed detection of flaw detection parts and large fluctuations in imaging quality. It is urgent to develop intelligent partition parameter adjustment filming technology. For this reason, this paper proposes a method for generating virtual flaw detection images for X-ray inspection of castings. Firstly, the casting coordinate dimension reduction mapping model is established, and the dimension reduction mapping of the casting three-dimensional coordinates to the two-dimensional coordinates of the imaging plate is realized. Secondly, the simulation imaging parameter fitting model is established, and the simulation flaw detection image of the standard three-dimensional model of the casting is generated by the point source virtual ray. Finally, a virtual imaging system for X-ray inspection of castings is developed by integrating the two models. This method can provide optimized imaging attitude and imaging parameter information for actual flaw detection, and provide theoretical support for intelligent partition parameter adjustment and filming technology. © 2024 Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society.

Thus, in this paper, a new adaptative slicing method based on the cusp vector and the surface deviation is proposed with the aim of minimizing the dimensional defects of FFF printed parts and investigate the impact on the dimensional part tolerancing. An algorithm is developed to automatically extract data from the STL file, select the build orientation, and detect intersection points between the initial slicing and the STL mesh. The innovation of this algorithm is exhibited via adapting the slicing according to the surface curvature based on two factors: the cusp vector and the surface deviation. The suggested slicing technique guarantees dimensional accuracy, especially for complex feature shapes that are challenging to achieve using a uniform slicing approach. Finally, a preview of the slicing is displayed, and the G-code is generated to be used by the FFF machine. The case study consists of the dimensional tolerance inspection of prototypes manufactured using the conventional and adaptive slicing processes. The proposed method’s effectiveness is investigated using RE and CMM processes. The method demonstrates its reliability through the observed potential for accuracy improvements exceeding 0.6% and cost savings of up to 4.3% in specific scenarios. This reliability is substantiated by comparing the resulting dimensional tolerances and manufacturing costs. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {When an electromagnetic sensor composed of a static excitation coil and a detection coil is moved in a steel tube at high speed, an eddy current is generated in the steel tube. If a defect is present in the steel tube, the defect may be detected by the change in the eddy current. Generally, the ferromagnetic heat transfer tubes in oil and chemical plants are inspected for defects by moving an internally inserted electromagnetic sensor at a high speed of about 1 m/s. Although there have been some past research reports for the detection of localized thinning in the steel tube, there are no reports for a wide range of thinning in the steel tube. Therefore, in this research, it is investigated a thickness measurement method for a wide range of thinning on the steel tube using only static magnetic field. As a result, it was shown that it is possible to measure the thickness in the steel tube by flux density inside the detection coil of the proposed static magnetic inspection sensor moving at 1m/s. The flux density in the steel tube is evaluated by the 3-D nonlinear FEM considering the velocity effect.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Marine growth challenges the structural integrity of offshore facilities due to increased hydro dynamical loads. As a consequence, marine growth cleaning on offshore structures has been performed for many years. While the industry has shifted from diver-assisted to cleaning driven by remotely operated vehicles, the process remains costly and ineffective. This paper explores the possibilities for introducing an increased level of automation for marine growth inspection and classification. Specific attention is given to sensor technologies and methods for constructing a 3D representation of the offshore structures in order to assess the thickness and composition of marine growth. While optical-based methods show positive potential further work is needed to investigate the robustness to flicking sunlight and turbidity issues experienced in areas close to the water surface. The review of classification methods reveals several promising approaches where deep learning is applied for the categorization of marine growth. The training relies on large databases of relevant images which are not currently available for marine growth on offshore structures. Further work is needed for investigating if virtual images can be used in combination with a reduced set of real images.  © 2022 IEEE.},

Unfortunately, it may be computationally intensive for the simulation models. To improve the efficiency of the MAPoD, in this article, an efficient 3D eddy current nondestructive evaluation (ECNDE) forward solver is proposed to make estimations for PoD study. It is the first time that singular value decomposition (SVD) is used as the recompression technique to improve the overall performance of the adaptive cross approximation (ACA) algorithm-based boundary element method (BEM) ECNDE forward solver for implementation of PoD. Both the robustness and efficiency of the proposed solver are demonstrated and testified by comparing the predicted impedance variations of the coil with analytical, semi-analytical and experimental benchmarks. Calculation of PoD curves assisted by the proposed simulation model is performed on a finite thickness plate with a rectangular surface flaw. The features, which are the maximum impedance variations of the coil for various flaw lengths, are obtained entirely by the proposed model with selection of the liftoff distance as the uncertain parameter in a Gaussian distribution. The results show that the proposed ACA-SVD based BEM fast ECNDE forward solver is an excellent simulation model to make estimations for MAPoD study. © 2022 by the authors.},

In order to ensure structural integrity, regular inspection and cleaning procedures are carried out on the submerged structures, most commonly using remote-operated vehicles (ROVs). Often, the measurement methodology in these inspections is spot-checks using simple mechanical gauges, which yield a rough estimate of marine growth thickness. Expanding on this method, in order to optimize these inspection and cleaning procedures, modern methods for 3D surface measurement can be applied to increase inspection quality and ensure that superfluous cleaning is not carried out. This work investigates three state-of-the-art sensor technologies: a Time-of-Flight depth camera based on modulated visible blue laser illumination, a commercial stereo-vision solution based on visible-light sensors, and high-frequency imaging sonar. The sensors' performance has been compared in a laboratory environment to assess their suitability for use as a measurement device for marine-growth measurement in terms of accuracy, resolution, and noise/artifacts. It is concluded that the measurement fidelity of all evaluated sensors shows promise for the application, pending future evaluation in a real-world test. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: The accuracy of digital implant transfer is currently under investigation in relation to the effect of saliva, scan body material, and exposed length. Methods: Six completely edentulous casts with four implant fixtures were fabricated. The four implant fixtures in each cast were placed below the crest of the ridge of the casts by 1.5 mm. The four implant fixtures were alternately attached to four implant scan bodies (PEEK) Group (I) and (TITANIUM) Group (II). For each cast, two flexible polyurethane layers with varying thicknesses were fabricated and molded on the six 3D printed identical casts after the placement of the implant fixtures in each cast for the soft tissue moulage in the cast. The six casts were alternately covered with a 2 mm and 4 mm thick layer. The six reference casts were recorded using a coordinate measurement machine (CMM) and subsequently scanned with an Intraoral scanner (MEDIT I 700). The scanning was conducted under both dry and wet conditions, with artificial saliva applied. The scanning platform consisted of two transparent acrylic boxes, and the process followed standardized scanning conditions using a digital lux meter (n = 48). The mean difference and standard deviation values (± SD) between the implant scan bodies measured on the reference and experimental scans were calculated using the inspection software program (Medit design). Data were fed to the computer and analyzed using IBM SPSS software package version 20.0. (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Shapiro-Wilk test were used to verify the normality of distribution. Quantitative data mean and standard deviation. The significance of the obtained results was determined at the 5% level. The student t-test for normally distributed quantitative variables was used to compare the two groups studied. Results: Statistically significant differences in wettability condition discrepancies were found between groups (I) and (II) (p < 0.05). In addition, there were statistically significant differences in intraoral scan body (ISB) length between the two groups (p < 0.05). Regarding the intraoral scan body material, statistically significant differences were found between the two groups (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The presence of saliva significantly affects the accuracy of the digital implant transfer. Additionally, using a longer intraoral scan body improves the accuracy of digital implant impressions. The titanium scan body had a greater level of precision on the implant impression scan. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Objective Deep-space exploration is important to innovate space technology and explore space resources. A collimator is a key component of a deep-space probe; however, producing a high spatial resolution collimator is challenging. Currently, the deep-space exploration collimator grid is mostly composed of frames. Casting or laser additive manufacturing is used to build the inner grid structure, which is quite thick, as well as the entire outside wall. The grid frame is then used to create the microgrooves. Finally, the collimator grid is formed by inserting tungsten or tantalum foils into the microgrooves. Furthermore, collimator grid manufacturing technologies include LIGA and electrical discharge wire-cutting. These approaches may result in thick walls, limiting the collimator' s duty ratio and efficiency, or result in a longer manufacturing period, higher cost, and a smaller grid height. The hard X-ray modulation telescope satellite (HXMT), which China developed independently, is used as an example to present our research progress on laser microwelding technology and equipment development for the cross-scale collimator grid, which is funded by the National Key Research and Development Program. Methods The laser spot welding experiment was conducted first to identify the welding parameters based on the structural features of the HXMT collimator. The grid deformation finite element analysis was then performed to provide laser welding guidance. Finally, laser welding equipment was designed and validated to meet the grid cell laser welding requirements. Results and Discussions The HXMT collimator is composed of an aluminum alloy frame with many tantalum grid cells placed into it. Laser spot welding junction points formed by two orthogonal arrays of tantalum foils are used to create the grid cell. The fabrication of tantalum foils, grid cell assembly and welding, and grid cell insertion into the collimator frame are all part of the manufacturing process (Fig. 3). For laser welding grid cells, an IPG YLM-150/ 1500-QCW quasicontinuous fiber laser and a self-developed three-dimensional (3D) dynamic focusing galvanometer are employed. With a beam diameter of 40 ;im, laser power of 180-220 W, and pulse width of 6-10 ms, a well-formed welding spot is created (Fig. 4). The results of the finite element analysis show that instability deformation is common during the laser welding of the collimator grid cell (Fig. 5). To address this issue, an integrated set combining tantalum foil assembly and collimator grid welding/insertion is developed (Fig. 6). The assembly error and welding deformation are well-controlled, resulting in the collimating hole' s dimensions accuracy being within +20 fim. The self-designed laser microwelding equipment consists primarily of a quasicontinuous fiber laser, a self-developed 3D dynamic focusing galvanometer, an X/Y motion platform with a Z support frame and motion axis, a CCD vision inspection system, and a computer control system, among other components (Fig. 7). Before welding, the stage moves to the CCD field of view to locate the welding point; next, the stage moves to the galvanometer, which can quickly and accurately regulate the movement of the laser beam, allowing for the rapid and precise welding of each grid cell's welding spot. After welding, the stage returns to the CCD field of view to detect and evaluate welding quality (Fig. 8). Conclusions High-efficiency laser microwelding and detection of large depth and high spatial resolution collimator grid have been realized using linkage technology of online visual inspection, dynamic focusing galvanometer, and CNC machine as well as the development of an integrated set to combine tantalum foil assembly and collimator grid welding/insertion, as along with the development of laser microwelding equipment and welding process. The accuracy of collimating hole size can be controlled within +20 ;im for the tantalum collimator grid with 70 ;im wall thickness, 1.17 mm x 4.68 mm collimating hole size, and 67 mm depth. © 2022 Science Press.

	abstract = {The main cause of structural deficiency in steel bridges is corrosion damage at girder ends caused by the leakage of bridge joints. This localized corrosion damage reduces steel girders’ bearing strength and affects bridge structures’ overall load-carrying capacity. Accurate estimation of the residual strength of corroded elements is critical for prioritizing repair projects and allocating funding and resources. However, due to the varied environment around the metal surface, corrosion damage on bridge girders is highly variable in severity and shape. The inspection results could vary greatly from inspector to inspector using the current methods. The accuracy of the inspection cannot be ensured. To address this limitation, this study proposes a methodology for creating a computationally efficient finite element (FE) model of a steel plate girder end with the exact representation of the geometry of the corroded region using 3D scan data. The point cloud data from a high-resolution structured-light 3D scanner is used to obtain geometric features such as plate boundaries, connectivity between plates, and thickness variations across plates. This information is used to automatically create a FE model of the damaged girder using shell elements. The applicability and accuracy of the proposed methodology were evaluated using the results from the load testing of a full-scale girder with corrosion damage. The agreement between the experimental and analytical failure mode, force–displacement relationship, and strain distribution on the plates demonstrated the accuracy of the method for estimating the residual bearing strength of plate girders with corrosion damage. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Structural timber is one of the commonly used construction materials. Timber can contain natural internal defect such as knot or natural decay due to its anatomical complexity. Moreover, internal damages or stiffness reductions can also be induced by environmental and biological factors such as weathering and termite attacks. This hidden internal damage increases the difficulty of damage detection using conventional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods. Ultrasonic guided wave (GW) damage detection technique is one of the promising damage detection techniques, which can be employed to achieve an effective and robust damage inspection in timber. However, limited attention has been paid to the use of GW for damage detection in timber, due to the material anisotropy and inhomogeneity. This paper assesses the capability of GW in detecting different sizes of the internal damages in a structural red oak timber using the fundamental anti-symmetric mode (A0) of GW. Measured GW signals in forward and backward scattering directions are used to calculate the reflection and transmission ratios for different sizes of internal damages. A series of comprehensive experimental and numerical parametric studies are carried out using three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) simulations. Good agreement is obtained between numerical and experimental results. The experimentally verified FE model is utilized to further investigate the wave reflection and transmission phenomena from different characteristics of internal damages, such as different lengths, widths, thicknesses, and through thickness locations. The outcomes of this study demonstrate the robustness of GW technique in detecting conspicuous internal damages in structural timber. It demonstrates the feasibility of quantitative assessments of internal damages in timber using A0 GW. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In new high definition lighting modules, assembling more than thousand elements (pixels) with a single mm-sized motherboard is achieved by reflow soldering. Lead-free solders may constitute a weak part of electronic components and LED assemblies. During reflow, the distance between pixels and motherboard controls the solder heights (10 μm). After assembly, all the pixels are in a single plane. To ensure constant solder heights, this plane has to be parallel to the motherboard. A small disorientation during reflow may lead to severe solder damage prior to any use of the opto-electronic component. Present work presents a novel non-destructive method for characterizing any chosen solder in the assembled component without unpacking the latter. A femtosecond motorized laser source is used for digging a hole in the LED above the selected solder. Then a Focused Ion Beam facility allows to mill around this specific solder. The same FIB facility allows making several hundred slices of controlled thickness and orientation in the solder material. During this slicing operation, high-resolution inspection is done by FEG-SEM (Field Emission Gun - Scanning Electron Microscope) imaging. 3D tomographic reconstruction of the solder is obtained by classical commercial software AVIZO. Finally, 3D damage in solder material is illustrated by example results. © 2022},

	abstract = {Inspecting damage through visual inspection is an outdated and inefficient method, especially for large concrete dam structures. Furthermore, inspecting for damage to dam structures is costly, time-consuming, and hazardous. This research proposes a novel method for detecting and measuring cracks in the concrete structure of dams by utilizing a combination of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) algorithm and image-based 3D modeling. The method enables the identification of cracks on large structures at a pixel level, facilitating detection over a wide area and with high accuracy. Specifically, the approach detects cracks on the three-dimensional surface of the dam, providing a comprehensive and effective means of identifying potential structural issues. To accurately determine the size of the detected damage, the local thickness (LT) algorithm is introduced. This algorithm utilizes the pixel-precise detection capabilities of crack detection to provide highly precise crack size measurements. The CNN-FCN system segments cracks at the pixel level on the texture space obtained from a 3D model created through photogrammetry techniques. Then the trained CNN is employed to detect crack patches, which are then imported into a trained FCN system for pixel-level segmentation. The predicted crack pixels are converted to a physical scale by the LT algorithm to quantitatively measure the morphological features of cracks. The resulting crack map is then projected onto a 3D model, providing a comprehensive visual representation of the cracks. The proposed crack detection method can achieve an accuracy of over 90%. The study revealed that the presented system could efficiently and precisely detect, locate, and measure the size of cracks in large dam structures, highlighting the potential of the proposed method to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of crack inspection. Furthermore, the visualization of cracks on 3D models can help increase inspectors' inspection efficiency. © 2023 by DEStech Publi cations, Inc. All rights reserved},

	abstract = {Pipelines are typically used to transport oil, natural gas, water, etc. It is one of the most effective methods for transferring fluids over long distances. However, long-term usage of these pipes without maintenance results in the formation of residues, which will pave the way for pipeline accidents and soil contamination. To ensure the safety and protection of resources, these sustainable pipelines need to be inspected to avoid losses. This work aims to investigate various internal defect leaks in the non-uniform thickness of sustainable water pipes that are joined with a pipe expander. The magnetic flux leakage technique was implemented to evaluate these defects by means of a flexible GMR sensor array. An inspection robot containing two units was fabricated with the aid of 3D printing. The power unit provides the necessary thrust to actuate the entire robot whereas the sensing unit is responsible for analyzing the leaks. The robot’s movement is predicted by the MPU6050 and ultrasonic distance sensors that are plotted as motion plots. The sensing unit consists of permanent magnets and a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) array to interrogate the flux leakage in the defect region. The flux leakage from the defects was stored with the help of an Arduino microcontroller, which controls the overall process. In addition, the spring suspension is provided to regulate the motion of the robot. The flux leakage from the defect region was plotted as waveform graphs. Thus, the results are effectively presented and compared. The calculated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the magnetic flux leakages (MFLs) for 4.5 mm-thick pipe defects was 12 to 20.8 dB, and for 6.52 mm-thick pipe defects, it was 9.5 to 19 dB. In sum, the MFL technique provides a reliable method for the sustainable development of water supply to wide areas. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) plays an important role in ophthalmology and automatic analysis of the OCT is of real importance: image denoising facilitates a better diagnosis and image segmentation and classification are undeniably critical in treatment evaluation. Synthetic OCT was recently considered to provide a benchmark for quantitative comparison of automatic algorithms and to be utilized in the training stage of novel solutions based on deep learning. Due to complicated data structure in retinal OCTs, a limited number of delineated OCT datasets are already available in presence of abnormalities; furthermore, the intrinsic three-dimensional (3D) structure of OCT is ignored in many public 2D datasets. We propose a new synthetic method, applicable to 3D data and feasible in presence of abnormalities like diabetic macular edema (DME). In this method, a limited number of OCT data is used during the training step and the Active Shape Model is used to produce synthetic OCTs plus delineation of retinal boundaries and location of abnormalities. Statistical comparison of thickness maps showed that synthetic dataset can be used as a statistically acceptable representative of the original dataset (p > 0.05). Visual inspection of the synthesized vessels was also promising. Regarding the texture features of the synthesized datasets, Q-Q plots were used, and even in cases that the points have slightly digressed from the straight line, the p-values of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test rejected the null hypothesis and showed the same distribution in texture features of the real and the synthetic data. The proposed algorithm provides a unique benchmark for comparison of OCT enhancement methods and a tailored augmentation method to overcome the limited number of OCTs in deep learning algorithms.

	abstract = {The use of additive technologies in the creation of soldering masks opens up new opportunities in the production of printed circuit boards, in particular, the use of soldering masks for boards with integrated components. The paper considers the results of experimental data on the adhesion of 3D soldering masks (that is, masks created on a 3D printer) obtained during the study of the introduction of 3D printing into electronic manufacturing processes. For the analysis of adhesion, it is possible to use such methods as breaking load, cross-cut test, and the sticky tape method. A number of experiments were conducted to study the adhesion by testing the breaking load. The samples were formed with different ratios of prepreg/solder mask, then the force at which the fracture occurred was measured. The essence of the cross-cut test is to apply at least three parallel cuts and perpendicular to them also at least three parallel cuts with the tip of the cutter. After the scratching, there must be no flaking of the coating between the lines and in the grid of squares, then the results are assessed. Sticky tape tests are performed by applying the tape with the adhesive side to the test sample with a cured coating applied. The results are assessed by visual inspection using an optical device that provides 3x magnification. The results of the breaking load experiments indicate that 3D masks show comparable separation forces with a prepreg. At the same time, the force is stable for all types of surfaces and practically does not depend on the thickness and configuration of the 3D mask. Experiments with applying cross-cuts show consistently good results with a homogeneous base material - there are no coating detachments. The paper concludes that the use of 3D soldering masks on the inner layers of multilayer printed circuit boards with built-in components is possible, but a number of issues must be solved for this, including those related to the software for forming 3D structures of masks. © 2021 The Author.

	abstract = {Eutectic bonding is the primary method of integrated packaging for achieving efficient heat dissipation in power chips. However, for specialized power chips for wire-free packages with hot-via interconnections between upper layer and the backside pads on the lower layer, achieving high-precision, zero-damage, and highly reliable eutectic bonding is challenging using conventional equipment and methods. This paper proposes a simple and efficient approach that employs a specially designed Si-based fixture and thermocompression bonding process to achieve eutectic bonding of such kind of power chips. The fixture is fabricated using MEMS technology and comprises two layers: a structural layer and a thermal barrier layer. The structural layer features numerous micro-cavities that enable effective avoidance of air bridges when power chips are placed face-down. The thermal barrier layer assists in controlling the temperature of the solder layer during back-end co-soldering, thereby enhancing the reliability of the solder joint. Finite element simulations were carried out to analyze the heat transfer path during the eutectic process. The results indicate that when the thickness of the barrier layer is 200 micrometers, the temperature of the bonding tool reaches 300, while the temperature of the solder layer reaches 280. Finally, we fabricated samples and conducted X-ray inspection, which showed satisfactory results in terms of alignment accuracy and soldering quality. This provides a feasible solution for high-precision and high-quality automated eutectic bonding of power chips in wire-free 3D stacking packages. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Endometrial thickness (EMT) and blood flow are commonly used indicators of endometrial receptivity. However, the results of single ultrasound examination studies differ. Therefore, we used 3-dimensional (3D) ultrasound to study the influence of changes in EMT, endometrial volume, and endometrial blood flow on frozen embryo transfer cycles. Methods: This was a prospective cross-sectional study. Women who underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF) at Dalian Women and Children’s Medical Group and met the inclusion criteria were enrolled between September 2020 and July 2021. Ultrasound examinations were performed in patients who underwent frozen embryo transfer cycles on the day of progesterone administration, the third day after progesterone administration, and the day of embryo transplantation. Two-dimensional ultrasound was used to record EMT, 3D ultrasound was used to record endometrial volume, and 3D power Doppler ultrasound imaging was used to record the following endometrial blood flow parameters: vascular index, flow index, and vascular flow index. Changes in the 3 inspections of the EMT, volume, vascular index, flow index, and vascular flow index and 2 inspections of estrogen levels were categorized as “declining” or “nondeclining”. The relationship between changes in a certain indicator and the IVF outcome was analyzed by univariate analysis and multifactorial stepwise logistic regression. Results: In total, 133 patients were enrolled in this study, 48 were excluded, and 85 were included in the statistical analysis. Among these 85 patients, 61 were pregnant (71%), 47 had a clinical pregnancy (55%), and 39 had an ongoing pregnancy (45%). The results showed that if the first change in endometrial volume was nondeclining, the outcomes of clinical and ongoing pregnancies were more likely to be unfavorable (P=0.03, P=0.01). Additionally, if the second change in endometrial volume on the day of embryo transplantation was nondeclining, the outcome of an ongoing pregnancy was more likely to be favorable (P=0.03). Conclusions: The changes in endometrial volume was a factor helpful in predicting the IVF outcome, whereas the changes in EMT and endometrial blood flow analyses were not helpful in predicting IVF outcome. © 2023 AME Publishing Company.

The current inspection covers the investigation of trihybrid nanoparticles mixed in the cross-fluid model part of a rotating stretched surface in the presence of a heat source/sink, radiation effect, and nonlinear/linear convection. A trihybrid fluid is a unique type of fluid that surpasses hybrid nanofluids, conventional fluids, and nanofluids. Moreover, acetone and engine oil interchange energy in comparison to other liquids. Trihybrid fluids are now widely used in facilities such as electrical chillers, biotechnology, power pumps, the automotive industry, and air cleaners. The flow presenting model equations are derived in a rotating frame to study the momentum and thermal transportation in a nanofluid. The modeled problem was simplified by considering the boundary layer principle, which resulted in the formation of complex coupled partial differential equations (PDEs). The derived PDEs were converted into the corresponding nonlinear ODEs using suitable similarity transformations. Then, the converted ordinary differential equations (ODEs) were solved numerically via a strong and authentic procedure called finite element procedure from the current inspection; it is recoded that finite element method is a powerful method to handle complex problems arising in modeling of several mechanisms. © 2023 De Gruyter.

	abstract = {Objective Terahertz (THz) waveguides are essential functional devices for the long-distance propagation and interconnection of THz waves; thus, they play an increasingly important role in THz applications, i.e., in wireless communications, medical imaging, and security inspections. To achieve high transmission efficiency and integration, various THz waveguides using different guiding mechanisms have been developed, including dielectric, photonic crystal, anti-resonance, and surface plasmonic waveguides. Recently, graphene-based hybrid plasmonic THz waveguides have attracted significant attention because of their tunable and flexible transmission. However, the inherent optical properties of two-dimensional graphene, such as the low absorption of incident waves and weak electromagnetic response, pose challenges in the design of high-performance waveguides. Emerging three-dimensional Dirac semimetals (3D DSMs) have high carrier mobilities and tunable energy band characteristics comparable to those of graphene, while overcoming the above-mentioned inherent shortcomings of graphene. In this study, we propose a tunable broadband hybrid plasmonic THz waveguide based on a 3D DSM dielectric ridge structure. The transmission characteristics are systematically simulated using the finite element method, and the effects of the structural parameters and Fermi energy of the DSM are analyzed. Methods A THz waveguide structure is designed in this study based on a 3D DSM hybrid plasmonic mechanism, which comprises a DSM layer, SiO2 layer, and Si layer from top to bottom (Fig. 1). The corresponding thicknesses are optimized to be 4, 2, and 10 μm, respectively. First, the complex permittivity of the 3D DSM at different Fermi levels in the THz regime is calculated based on the Kubo formula and two-band model (Fig. 2). Finite element method-based simulations are performed to reveal the quantitative influences of the structural geometric parameters and DSM Fermi energy on the THz transmission characteristics, including the real part of the effective mode index, normalized mode area, propagation length, figure of merit, and propagation mode. Results and Discussions The simulated results show that the effective mode refractive index decreases and the normalized mode area increases with increasing dielectric gap height. Owing to the enhanced low-loss dielectric mode characteristics, the propagation length and figure of merit (FOM) increase with the gap height, and the 3D DSM plasmonic properties weaken as the frequency increases (Fig. 3). It can be observed from the mode-field diagram that the loss of the waveguide gradually decreases as the gap height increases, and most of the modes in the waveguide can be restricted from propagating at the tip of the rhombic Si region (Fig. 4). As the size of the rhombic Si medium increases, more modes propagate into the high-refractive-index Si medium, and the role of the dielectric mode increases. As the mixed mode confined by the 3D DSM layer is weakened, the effective mode refractive index and mode area increase, and the dielectric mode gradually becomes dominant in the mixed mode, causing an increase in the propagation length (Fig. 5). Finally, the influence of the Fermi level on the propagation characteristics is analyzed. As the Fermi level changes from 0.01 eV to 0.1 eV, the propagation length of the waveguide can be greatly tuned from 3.33×102 μm to 1.72×104 μm with the maximum modulation depth of the propagation length up to 98.06%, and a modulation depth of more than 90% in the broad frequency range of 0.5‒2.0 THz can be achieved (Fig. 7). Conclusions A tunable broadband THz waveguide based on a 3D DSM is demonstrated through numerical simulations. The transmission characteristics in response to the dielectric gap height, medium size, and Fermi level of 3D DSM are investigated. The simulated results show that as the gap height increases, the real parts of the effective mode refractive index, normalized mode area, and propagation length increase. The side length of the rhombus medium also has a certain impact on the propagation characteristics. Specifically, the real parts of the effective mode refractive index, mode area, and propagation length increase with the side length of the rhombus medium. The Fermi level has a significant effect on the propagation characteristics. As the Fermi level of the 3D DSM increases, the real part of the effective mode refractive index decreases, whereas the mode area and propagation length increase. As the Fermi level increases from 0.01 eV to 0.10 eV, the propagation length of the waveguide increases from 3.33×102 μm to 1.72× 104 μm, and the modulation depth of the propagation length exceeds 90% in the broadband working frequency of 0.5‒2.0 THz. These findings provide an important reference for understanding the propagation mechanism of 3D DSM hybrid plasmonic waveguides, hence they are good candidates for various applications in tunable and broadband THz waveguides and modulators. © 2024 Science Press.

	abstract = {Multi-slice imaging can obtain the Three-dimensional(3D) information of thick objects by modeling specimen as a number of slices. This approach can be applied to biomedical imaging, integrated circuit inspection and sample thickness measurement. Multi-slice ptychography is a full-field and lensless imaging method exploiting 3D Ptychographic Iterative Engine (3PIE) algorithm to reconstruct the complex-value function of object planes and illumination beams simultaneously. Even though this method does not require prior knowledge, inaccurate initial guesses of the object planes lead to more iterations than for a single-slice object. Compressive holography (CH) is another method for reconstructing multi-slice objects. It enables to obtain 3D information from a single 2D Gabor hologram by compressive sensing (CS) algorithm. In this paper, both methods are combined and the corresponding algorithm is proposed, in which the reconstructed multi-slice object by CH is adopted as the initial guess for object planes in 3PIE providing a more accurate initial value. Experimentally, the ptychography data set and a single in-line hologram are recorded in sequence. The numerical simulation studies on double-slice and three-slice objects were conducted, respectively. Numerical simulation results indicate that our method has a smaller error compared to traditional methods and it can improve the convergence speed. The proposed method was experimentally demonstrated using a double-slice object. The conclusions drawn from the experiments are in agreement with the simulations. We expect our method to provide invaluable information for both the life and materials sciences. © 2024 SPIE.},

Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) methods can be implemented to reduce inspection costs and ensure structural integrity and safety in these parts. In this study, the Surface Response to Excitation (SuRE) method was used to investigate the wave propagation characteristics and load sensing capability in conventionally and additively manufactured ABS parts. For the first set of the test specimens, one conventionally manufactured and three additively manufactured rectangular bar-shaped specimens were prepared. Moreover, four additional parts were also additively manufactured with 30% and 60% infill ratios and 1 mm and 2 mm top surface thicknesses. The external geometry of all parts was the same. Ultrasonic surface waves were generated using three different signals via a piezoelectric actuator bonded to one end of the part. At the other end of each part, a piezoelectric disk was bonded to monitor the response to excitation. It was found that hollow sections inside the 3D printed part slowed down the wave travel. The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) were implemented for converting the recorded sensory data into time–frequency images. These image datasets were fed into a convolutional neural network for the estimation of the compressive loading when the load was applied at the center of specimens at five different levels (0 N, 50 N, 100 N, 150 N, and 200 N). The results showed that the classification accuracy was improved when the CWT scalograms were used. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To determine the impact of build orientation, increased layer thickness, and dental crowding on the trueness of three-dimensional (3D)–printed models, and to evaluate how these parameters affect the fit of thermoformed appliances. Materials and Methods: Ninety-six dental models were printed horizontally and vertically on the building platform using different 3D-printing technologies: (1) a stereolithography (SLA) printer with layer thicknesses of 160 lm and 300 lm and (2) a digital light processing (DLP) printer with layer thicknesses of 100 lm and 200 lm. Each printed model was digitalized and superimposed on the corresponding source file using 3D rendering software, and deviations were quantified by the root mean square values. Subsequently, a total of 32 thermoformed appliances were fabricated on top of the most accurate 3D-printed models, and their fit was evaluated by digital superimposition and inspection by three blinded orthodontists. Paired t-tests were used to analyze the data. Results: Significant differences (P, .05) between printing technologies used were identified for models printed horizontally, with the SLA system achieving better trueness, especially in crowded dentitions. No significant differences between technology were found when models were printed vertically. The highest values of deviation were recorded in appliances fabricated on top of DLP-printed models. The results of the qualitative evaluation indicated that appliances fabricated on top of SLA models outperformed the DLP-modeled appliances. Conclusions: Three-dimensional printing with increased layer height seems to produce accurate working models for orthodontic applications. © 2024 by The EH Angle Education and Research Foundation, Inc.},

	abstract = {Due to the significance and complexity of rail surface quality inspections on production lines, manual completion is inefficient. Existing 3D vision techniques, such as stereo vision, are too complex and cumbersome for industrial use. This paper introduces a straightforward and fast line laser calibration method, along with a rail surface defect detection approach using line laser 3D reconstruction. By projecting line lasers onto the sides of a calibration board of specific thickness, the position of the laser centerlines in the side areas is extracted to ascertain the world coordinates of the corresponding point clouds. Four sets of line laser measurement devices are then employed to conduct a full coverage scan of the rail. A streamlined multi-camera joint calibration method is presented, which stitches together 3D point clouds from various perspectives to recreate the complete cross-sectional profile of the rail. After transforming into a surface depth variation map, defects are identified based on depth thresholds. The method not only precisely locates and categorizes defects but also reduces reconstruction errors by 0.1mm and simplifies the calibration process by eliminating the need for multiple rotations of calibration targets, thereby speeding up and enhancing the feasibility of industrial application. The approach overcomes the complexities and cumbersome processes associated with traditional methods not suited for industrial settings. The system can detect at a speed of 1.5m/s, identifying surface defects deeper than 0.3mm with a verified accuracy of less than 0.02mm, thus fulfilling the requirements for rail surface defect inspection.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Matching infrared thermography (IRT) with deep learning-based computer vision has recently gained a lot of interest for automated defect assessment in materials. One of the remaining bottlenecks concerns the necessity of a large and diverse experimental and/or virtual training dataset in order to achieve a sufficiently generalizable computer vision algorithm. This paper presents a parametrized 3D finite element (FE) framework, implemented in Fortran90, for efficiently simulating optical infrared thermographic inspection of multi-layer anisotropic media and establishing large-scale virtual dataset with sufficient diversity. The interface element is introduced for the modelling of an imperfect thermal contact, allowing to simulate a variety of defect types. The flexibility of the interface element makes it possible to simulate delaminations with different thickness using the same discretized model. Validation is done for two benchmark cases which are representative for a fiber reinforced polymer laminate with delamination-like defects. In order to achieve true-to-nature thermographic simulation data, non-uniform heating conditions are adopted from experiment, and a stochastic morphology generator is introduced for modelling realistic irregular defect geometries. To demonstrate the added value of a large, diverse and true-to-nature virtual database for computer vision applications, a Faster-RCNN model was trained on a generated virtual dataset for the detection of delamination-like defects in fiber reinforced polymer laminates. Application of the trained Faster-RCNN on experimental thermographic data yields excellent inference results, illustrating the high generalization ability of the virtually trained object detector. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) parts retain a certain degree of individuality and could suffer from a combination of different defect types, and therefore the nondestructive evaluation on AM parts remains a challenging task. Engineering non-contact and nondestructive real-time inspection and in situ quality assurance of AM parts would be a net improvement compared to current quality control methods that are conducted post-production. Here, the authors propose to combine the use of a laser vibrometer with a compression-driven shock tube to assess the quality of AM parts through the evaluation of the vibration spectra of the part. An AM of a cylindrical part was selected for the study, along with different defect types and sizes. These defects include internal voids of different sizes at different locations, local changes in thickness (infill), and local changes in melting temperatures. A numerical model was created and validated using experimental data to conduct model-assisted probability of detection (MAPOD). Results were analyzed by evaluating correlation matrices between different models. Results showed that vibration spectra induced by a shock wave were sensitive to different types and sizes of defects under the studied geometry. The defect index yielded an approximately linear relationship with respect to defect void severity. MAPOD curve studies revealed a minimum detectable void defect of 0.039% of the AM part's volume.

The contours are compared to thickness measurements obtained by ultrasonic thickness gauge, and the results validate the efficiency of 3D scanning as a potential technology for bridge inspections. Then, in a second phase, experimental testing of a corroded girder is performed to obtain the capacity and the mode of failure. Finally, in the last part of the paper, the 3D scanning data are combined through an automated procedure with finite element analysis and analytical provisions to examine whether 3D scanning can inform these two tools reasonably for accurate capacity predictions.

	abstract = {Background: In this randomized controlled trial, we assessed the neuroprotective effect of a 12-week resistance training (RT) program on executive control and cortical thickness of the prefrontal, temporal, parietal, and central cortex, regions prone to structural decline in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: Seventy older adults (aged 60–85 y old, 38 females and 32 males) were randomly allocated to a 12-week lower limb RT program or a waiting list control group. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to stratify participants screened for high (< 26) or low (≥ 26) MCI risk. Cognitive measurements consisted of the two-choice reaction time, Go/No-go, mathematical processing, and memory search tests. Cortical thickness was estimated from 3D T1-weighted MR images. Results: Complete randomized controlled trial data was obtained from 50 individuals (24 with high MCI risk). Significant Group x Time interactions were found for response on the Go/No-go task and cortical thickness of the right parahippocampal gyrus [F ≥ 5.3, p ≤ 0.03; η2p ≥ 0.12]. An inspection of these observations revealed an increase in cortical thickness (+1.18 %) and a decrease in response time (-4.35 %) in individuals with high MCI risk allocated to the exercise group (both uncorrected p = 0.08). Decreased response time on the Go/No-go task was associated with increased cortical thickness in the right entorhinal gyrus (uncorrected p = 0.01). Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that 12 weeks of RT intervention may effectively improve cognitive performance and slow neuronal loss in the hippocampal complex of older adults at high MCI risk. Findings support evidence for the neuroprotective effects of resistance training and its potential role in cognitive health. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {Objective: Ternary blades are used in the impellers of aerospace turbojet engines, large-scale marine gas turbines, and automotive advanced turbine engines. The joints connecting the ternary blades to the impeller base are irregularly shaped surfaces. The ternary blade has special, complex, and spatial structure with a large inclination angle, large distortion, and other characteristics that conform to the ternary flow design theory; this design reduces energy loss when fluid travels through the impeller and improves its efficiency. Thus, ternary blade manufacturing has received considerable attention, and its unique structure imposes severe processing requirements. However, ternary blades are mainly processed by Computerized Numerical Control Electrical Discharge Machining (CNC EDM) and CNC milling; the number of materials eliminated during the processing is enormous, and the processing cycle is extensive. Laser additive manufacturing, a revolutionary type of forming technique, was proposed in the 1990s, which is used for efficient and moldless manufacturing of complicated structural elements. The research on laser additive manufacturing of ternary blades has significant practical applications. Currently, most multi-twisted blade formation, both home and abroad, is performed on a flat or cylindrical generatrix, and there are few reports on laser powder feeding additive manufacturing ternary blades on special-shaped base surfaces. The technique of streamline layering is proposed in this study, and the cladding formation of the ternary blade is effectively accomplished; this is based on the optical inner powder feeding cladding nozzle produced independently in the laboratory. Methods: The three-element blades described in this study are curved in the flow direction and are three-dimensionally twisted, with complex twisting and tilting characteristics. The blade stacking substrate is a concave curved surface rather than a standard horizontal substrate. However, it is challenging to obtain information on each unit's location and direction. The bottom of the three-element blade is an arc main base surface on the special-shaped base surface. Thus, this study proposes the following streamlined layering methods: first, the primary base surface is divided evenly in the radial direction to obtain circular arc slices perpendicular to the radial direction; second, the arc slices are divided equidistantly along the scanning direction to obtain the division unit; lastly, the vector formed by the centerline of the upper and lower planes of the division unit is used to determine the height and deflection direction. Further, when stacking, the nozzle's axis aligns with the dividing unit's direction; the cladding nozzle moves according to the division unit's position and direction, and the final splicing obtains the formed part of the ternary blade. Results and Discussions: To obtain segmentation units with varied structural characteristics, the streamline layering technique is developed for stacking the ternary blade's forming parts [Fig. 4(f)]. The homogeneous transformation matrix of each segmentation unit relative to the base coordinate system is determined through translation and rotation calculation, thus, determining the positional and directional information of each segmentation unit [Fig. 5(c)]. Further, the laser cladding nozzle in this study is an optical internal powder-feeding nozzle, which is independently developed in the laboratory; the cladding nozzle is installed on a six-axis robotic arm. During cladding, the axis of the cladding nozzle aligns with the dividing unit's direction and fits along the curve. The single-layer arc slice cladding is completed by splicing the trajectory of each segmentation unit, and the multilayer arc slice overlaps to generate the ternary blade laser cladding, forming a portion with an enormous inclination, complex bending, and torsion structure (Fig. 7). Conclusions: The streamline layering technique is proposed in this study to tackle the ternary blade laser cladding formation trajectory problem. The main base surface is evenly spaced along the radial direction to obtain arc slices perpendicular to the radial direction, which are then evenly spaced along the scanning direction to obtain the segmentation unit. The streamlined layering technique is proposed in this study to solve the problem of ternary blade structural parts layering, bending, and inclination, and to accomplish the accumulation of ternary blade forming parts. The inspection results of the formed parts are as follows: the surface of the ternary blade-formed parts is smooth, and the average surface roughness value is less than 4.065 μm, which effectively reduces the step effect; it achieves a good metallurgical combination with the irregular base surface, and the average thickness of the formed parts is 5.97 mm. The relative errors of thickness and torsion angle are from -1.4% to 1.03% and -4.67%, respectively. The forming accuracy is high. The heat accumulation at the laser molten pool is evident as the height of the formed part increases. Further, the microhardness reduces as the microstructure increases; the microhardness of the formed part ranges from 348.3 to 360.4 HV, and the metallographic structure is uniformly dense with no evident holes or cracks. © 2022, Chinese Lasers Press.

	abstract = {Microneedle arrays (µNA) are gaining popularity in the field of drug delivery due to their potential to minimize side effects compared to conventional hypodermic needles. Generally, µNA is manufacturing through three or two stages which lack of flexibility in design. 3d printing is one of the powerful method that could be employed in three or two stages. However, it could be extended to single stage by directly manufacturing µNA from designated material. Digital light processing (DLP) is a kind of 3d printing which is using in this study. A further understanding of DLP printing parameters would be investigated such as LED current (mA), curing time (sec), z-thickness (µm), and grayscale level image (0 to 255). This study explores the integration of DLP technology and machine learning (ML), namely DLP-ML, to manufacture µNA with customizable size, rapid production process, and reduced material wastage. The initial process in developing ML model is preparing a dataset obtained from experimental approach. An orthogonal table is simplified the number of experiment. The orthogonal table is contained five factors and five levels, L25. The dataset is divided into input and output and substituted to ML system. In this approach, ML algorithms are employed to determine the optimal digital mask patterns and printing parameters for DLP-ML manufacturing. The study is employed various ML configurations in term of algorithm and number of hidden layer. Under different algorithm, the sort of larger to lower accuracy is arranged Bayesian regularization backpropagation (BR10), Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation (LM10), and scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation (SCG10), respectively. It also notices that the deviation of BR10 is proving that µNA is manufactured uniformly on a substrate. It is ultimately selecting Bayesian regularization backpropagation for its superior accuracy, exceeding 90%. For different number of hidden layer, the default value, 10, is also resulting highest accuracy among others. Then, BR10 could be concluded as the best ML configuration in this case. This algorithm empowers DLP-ML manufacturing to produce µNA arrays with various aspect ratio (AR), representing the ratio between the height and base diameter of µNA. The AR of 15 is highest that could be performed and the critical AR of µNA bending is found at 7 (700/100). By harnessing the synergy of DLP-ML technologies, this research presents a promising avenue for the advancement of drug delivery systems, offering enhanced precision, scalability, and therapeutic efficacy in medical applications. Finally, DLP-ML is successfully developed a rapid µNA manufacturing with different dimensions very accurately. © 2024 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Manual wheel size inspection faces problems such as limited accuracy, low efficiency, and poor consistency. Machine vision technology can improve measurement accuracy, efficiency and consistency through high-resolution cameras and advanced image processing algorithms. However, due to factors such as difficult railside deployment, limited camera field of view and occlusion, it becomes difficult to obtain whole wheel data, thus affecting wheel size measurements. To address this problem, this paper proposes an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm improved by sampling consistency and distance threshold decay based on the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. Then, by adding calibration blocks and combining this algorithm to complete the point cloud registration of the whole wheel. Finally, based on the whole wheel data, the point set of the base point rounding and the wheel profile is extracted to complete the calculation of parameters such as wheel diameter, rim height, and rim thickness. The experimental results show that the registration algorithm in this paper improves the quality of registration by 24.311% on average compared with the original one. The measurement errors of wheel diameter, rim height, and rim thickness are only 0.5844mm, 0.2437mm, and 0.5484mm, which account for 0.0640%,0.8660%, and 1.8124% of the dimensions, respectively, and satisfy the requirements of wheel detection accuracy for trains. © 2024 SPIE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The objective was to determine the accuracy of 3D-printed dental models subjected to different storage conditions using six different material and printer combinations. Materials and Methods: Three completely dentate models were designed using dental CAD software (3Shape Dental System). A horseshoe-shaped solid base with a posterior horizontal bar was used. The models were printed in a horizontal direction against the building platform without support. The models were printed using six printers with the corresponding recommended resin material: Carbon M2 (DPR10), HeyGears A2D4K (Model HP UV2.0), Stratasys J5 (MED610), Stratasys Origin One (DM200), Envision One (E-Model LightDLP), and Asiga Pro4K (VeriModel) with a standard layer thickness of 50 μm. All printed models underwent scanning using a laboratory scanner (Sirona inEOS X5) after printing. Subsequently, the models were randomly assigned into three groups of storage conditions, LT: cold environment (4 ± 1°C), HT: hot and dry environment (50 ± 2°C), and RT: room temperature (25 ± 2°C) serving as the control. Each group was kept under the designated condition and was scanned at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 weeks. The total number of models (N) was 72, with 6 printers producing 12 models per printer for 3 storage conditions, resulting in 4 models for each storage condition and each printer. The generated STL files were imported into a 3D inspection software for comparison with the original STL files. In-tolerance percentage, the deviation RMS, trueness, and precision were obtained and analyzed with least square mean linear regression using JMP Pro 15 to identify the significant effects (α = 0.05). Results: The in-tolerance percentage as-printed was significantly different among different printers. Significant dimension deviations were observed after the first week of storage at HT and with subsequent weeks of storage. RT and LT did not show significant dimensional changes. Models printed with Carbon M2 showed the highest in-tolerance percentages compared to the other printers. Conclusions: The model deviations were affected by storage conditions and the printer used, with high-temperature storage showed least stability compared to low and room temperatures. No significant difference was observed between low and room temperature storage conditions. The Carbon M2 printer showed the highest accuracy among all printers tested. The region had a significant effect on the deviation measured, with the abutment body showing the least deviation. Among the 3D printers evaluated, A2D4K by HeyGears and Carbon M2 printers demonstrated the highest accuracy in terms of both precision and trueness. © 2024 by the American College of Prosthodontists.},

	abstract = {To ensure the structure integrity of the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV), the main challenge is the embrittlement of beltline material. However, the stress is more complex for the regions of Closure Head Penetration (CHP). Feedback of leakage at the CHP has been found during in-service inspection. Although the detailed mechanical evaluation of the RPV head and the CHP has been carried out by many international institutions, there are limited studies to concern structure integrity of CHP tube. The systematic analysis of the influence of material strength matching, assemble stress, the Welding Residual (WR) stress and work pressure load on the fracture is also limited. In this paper, the systematic influence of these factors is analyzed, and the distribution characteristics of Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) and the crack propagation characteristics are studied. The 2D model and accurate 3D model are carried out using the finite element method. The results show that the WR stress on the outer surface of the CHP and the area adjacent to the weld is larger than the yield strength of the material. There is a gap between the RPV and the upper part of the CHP. The attenuation rate of the WR stress in the outlet direction of RPV is lower than that in the inlet direction, so cracks are more likely to occur in the out of direction. The influence of WR stress on the circumferential stress distribution and fracture parameters in the wall thickness direction of CHP is bigger than the influence of assemble load and design condition load. However, the overall stress of CHP is low. The SIF values along the crack front have an asymmetric distribution, and the SIF value is very small. As the fatigue crack propagation life is much longer than the assumed limit in the design lifetime, the risk of fracture and crack fatigue propagation caused by mechanical stress is low. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is one of the earliest developed 3D printing processes, which has the advantages of a clean processing environment, low overall manufacturing costs, and a variety of optional materials. However, it still has the disadvantages of low dimensional accuracy and poor surface quality of the molded workpiece. Therefore, how to solve this annoying problem has become an important research topic in the current industry-university-research fields. In this study, a square container with a bottom area of 48 mm×48 mm, a height of 30 mm, and a thin wall of 6 mm was used as the design object, and four controllable factors were adopted: layer thickness (A), nozzle temperature (B), printing speed (C), and forming path (D), combined with Grey-Taguchi’s experiments and calculations are carried out in order to achieve the purpose of optimizing the inner volume (IV) and inner diagonal length (IDL) of the square container (dual-objective quality characteristics). The experimental results show that within the selected printing parameter range, the optimized process parameter combination is layer thickness of 0.25 mm (A3), nozzle temperature of 190 °C (B1), printing speed of 50 mm/s (C3) and the molding direction of the annular surface (D2). Finally, use the GOM Inspect software (ATOS Q 3D scanner) and vernier caliper (VC) to compare the physical errors. According to the verification results, the errors of IV and IDL of the square container obtained by optimizing process parameters are 0.49% and 1.53%, and 3.76% and 6.33% respectively in GOM Inspect software and vernier caliper measurement. The results of this optimization process not only prove that the GOM Inspect software has a considerable degree of accuracy, but also can be used as a means to improve FDM multi-quality printing process optimization when combined with the Grey-Taguchi method. © 2024 Institute of Physics Publishing.

	abstract = {Ballistic penetration of machine guards is a topic of great significance for ensuring safety and avoiding projection of objects out of the working space of machines. Although standardized tests are performed according to EU Directive 2006/42/EC, they have some limitations because they are carried out using a given penetrator that perpendicularly impacts a given surface of about 500 × 500 mm. Nevertheless, the withstanding capacity of those guards depends on a lot of different design parameters and physical quantities that have not been fully investigated. This paper is focused on the study of the influence of the machine guard size on the withstanding capacity to ballistic penetration throughout theoretical models and experimental tests based on an innovative method involving the use of 3D optical scanners for inspection. The experimental analyses described in this work, compared to theoretical results, demonstrate that a maximum plastic deformation area can be defined, independently of the plate size, given the same material, thickness, and penetrator. This result allows to set proper new ranges for standardized tests, overcoming the limitation of using specific sample sizes. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {In order to solve the problem of the difference in the diagnostic effect of different sequences of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations for anterior and posterior cruciate ligament injuries, the author proposes an MRI rehabilitation method to relieve anterior cruciate ligament injury in dancers. This method retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 60 patients with knee anterior and posterior cruciate ligament injuries in our hospital, and all patients were diagnosed with knee anterior and posterior cruciate ligament injuries. All patients underwent MRI 3D sequence and 2D sequence examination successively to compare anatomical measurements. This study aimed at comparing the measurements of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) between the two examination sequences; comparing the diagnosis; comparing the grading and judgment of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament injuries of the knee joint between the two inspection sequences; and comparing the diagnostic coincidence rates of the two examination sequences in the complete tear of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments of the knee. Experimental results show that, in terms of PCL and ACL, the angle, thickness, and length of two-dimensional MRI examination were significantly different from those of MRI examination and anatomical measurement (P<0.05); for PCL and ACL, the angle, thickness, and length of 3D MRI were not significantly different from anatomical measurements (P>0.05). The diagnostic accuracy of 2D MRI was 83.33%, which was lower than 95.00% of 3D MRI (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the grading of anterior and posterior cruciate ligament injuries between the two examination sequences (P>0.05). The diagnostic coincidence rates of 3D MRI and 2D MRI for complete tear of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments were 95.55% and 80.00%, respectively (P<0.05). In conclusion, three-dimensional MRI examination can obtain higher diagnostic value for patients with knee joint anterior and posterior cruciate ligament injury.  © 2022 Pin Yang.},

	abstract = {The structures of short fiber reinforced composites become designable from macroscopic to microscopic due to the advancement in additive manufacturing technologies. The diffuse ultrasonic wave inspection benefits from information from multiple scattering processes, which is suitable for the quality assurance of complex structures. This study established a two-dimensional wave propagation model assuming the decoupling of the fiber volume into the fiber distribution matrix in the plane and the local fiber fraction along the thickness axis. The k-space pseudospectral method was applied to calculate the diffuse wave fields. The defect inspection process was studied numerically based on the Locadiff technique for additive-manufactured short-fiber reinforced composites. The stretching method provided the same average distance but a smaller relative deviation to the defect than the doublet method. The localization resolution improved significantly for the initial increment of the number of transmitters; limited improvement can be achieved further. Localization results fluctuated when the transmitter combination groups were distant from the defect. This method worked well with the isotropic and quasi-isotropic plates, while an oversimplification was found for the unidirectional fiber structure. Copyright © 2022 Peng, Xu, Sun, Zuo and Zhu.},

	abstract = {Sunflower seeds, recognized for their nutritional value and taste, are a well-loved snack. However, throughout their growth and storage, sunflower seeds can develop various defects that not only compromise their quality but also present potential health hazards. To address these issues and ensure adherence to safety standards, we investigate the use of THz spectroscopy and imaging techniques for nondestructive identification and classification of common defects in sunflower seeds. The study begins by analyzing spectroscopy features to identify defective seeds, particularly those affected by mildew. It establishes three qualitative discrimination models (support vector machine, random forest, and backpropagation neural networks), which achieve overall accuracies of 88.3%, 91.7%, and 95%, respectively. Furthermore, THz transmission imaging is employed as a quantitative method to visualize the internal structure of sunflower kernels and provide precise plumpness estimates. A noteworthy innovation is the analysis of time delays in reflected pulses at each pixel, enabling the extraction of valuable kernel thickness information. These data are then utilized to convert traditional two-dimensional scanning data into intricate three-dimensional (3D) images, facilitating direct measurements of both 3D plumpness and kernel weight. The findings have significant implications for improving the quality and safety of sunflower seeds and may extend to the assessment of other agricultural products, contributing to enhanced quality control in the food industry. © 2024 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)},

The presence of a defect in the steel tube may be detected via changes in the eddy current. In general, the ferromagnetic heat transfer tubes in oil and chemical plants are inspected for defects by moving an internally inserted electromagnetic sensor at a high speed of 1 m/s. Although previous studies have focused on the detection of localized thinning in the steel tube, there are no reports on a wide range of thinning in the steel tube. Therefore, this study investigated a thickness measurement method for a wide range of thinning in the steel tube using only a static magnetic field. Consequently, the possibility of measuring the thickness in the steel tube based on the flux density inside the detection coil of the proposed static magnetic inspection sensor moving at 1 m/s was demonstrated. The flux density in the steel tube was evaluated by the 3-D nonlinear finite-element method (FEM) considering the velocity effect.  © 1965-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Thin-walled milled monolithic aluminum workpieces are common in the aerospace industry, because of their advantages such as favorable material properties, established design methods, good machinability, known performance and reliable inspection techniques. Machining-induced residual stresses (MIRS) and initial bulk residual stresses (IBRS) are known to be the key factor for causing distortion of those workpieces. In this study the effect of both types, the milling path strategy and the wall thickness on the distortion is analyzed. A developed 3D linear elastic finite element (FEM) model, considering both types of RS as input, and predicting the resulting part distortion, is extended by using the true milling path as well as all RS contained in the entire workpiece. The simulation outcome is validated by experiments and distortion minimization techniques are derived. The results show that the model predicts the distortion shape and level for different wall thicknesses and milling strategies with a high accuracy. The experiments indicated that the distortion of low IBRS parts with 3 mm wall-thickness could be minimized by 42% by only changing the milling path. The simulation highlighted, that for smaller wall thicknesses, the distortion minimization potential is even higher (e.g. 2 mm wall thickness: up to 69% distortion minimization). For high IBRS parts, milling the inverse form of the predicted shape on the backside of the workpiece represents an alternative, which led up to a reduction of the distortion by 77%. In general, three main categories for precontrol distortion techniques can be identified as the process parameters, the part topology and the process strategy. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Metal additive manufacturing (AM) promises functional flexibility in the production of engineering components, and great progress has been made with respect to part geometry and overall performance criteria. The fracture and fatigue behaviors of metals depend on the sample microstructure, an aspect of metal AM for which many challenges remain. Here, we report on progress with respect to the rolling contact fatigue (RCF) performance of metal AM bearing rollers. A set of rollers was created using laser powder bed fusion from 8620HC steel powder. The print parameters were first studied with respect to laser power, laser scan speed, laser spot size, and layer thickness. A set of tapered cylindrical rollers was then manufactured using build parameters that were selected based on material density, optical microscopy, ultrasound, and residual stress measurements. The rollers were then heat-treated while still on the build plate to relieve any residual stresses. The rollers were removed from the build plate, machined to the typical product geometry, case-hardened, carburized, and ground to a final surface finish. Finally, the rollers were integrated within railroad tapered roller bearings and tested in two ways. The accelerated life test subjected the rollers to high-stress RCF that generated significant spalling on both types of rollers. The simulated service life test was designed with RCF at levels typical of in-service bearings. At the conclusion of this test, equivalent to 250, 000 miles, the performance of the AM rollers was judged to be in line with rollers manufactured using traditional methods, and visual inspections showed no surface damage to any rollers. The results of this study provide a clear foundation for additional AM roller designs that can exploit the unique capabilities of the AM process.

	abstract = {7T MRI provides unprecedented resolution for examining human brain anatomy in vivo. For example, 7T MRI enables deep thickness measurement of laminar subdivisions in the right fusiform area. Existing laminar thickness measurement on 7T is labor intensive, and error prone since the visual inspection of the image is typically along one of the three orthogonal planes (axial, coronal, or sagittal view). To overcome this, we propose a new analytics tool that allows flexible quantification of cortical thickness on a 2D plane that is orthogonal to the cortical surface (beyond axial, coronal, and sagittal views) based on the 3D computational surface reconstruction. The proposed method further distinguishes high quality 2D planes and the low-quality ones by automatically inspecting the angles between the surface normals and slice direction. In our approach, we acquired a pair of 3T and 7T scans (same subject). We extracted the brain surfaces from the 3T scan using MaCRUISE and projected the surface to the 7T scan’s space. After computing the angles between the surface normals and axial direction vector, we found that 18.58% of surface points were angled at more than 80° with the axial direction vector and had 2D axial planes with visually distinguishable cortical layers. 15.12% of the surface points with normal vectors angled at 30° or lesser with the axial direction, had poor 2D axial slices for visual inspection of the cortical layers. This effort promises to dramatically extend the area of cortex that can be quantified with ultra-high resolution in-plane imaging methods. © 2022 SPIE},

	abstract = {Hyperboloid cooling towers are counted among the largest cast-in-place industrial structures. They are an essential element of cooling systems used in many power plants in service today. Their main structural component, a reinforced-concrete shell in the form of a one-sheet hyperboloid with bidirectional curvature continuity, makes them stand out against other towers and poses very high construction and service requirements. The safe service and adequate durability of the hyperboloid structure are guaranteed by the proper geometric parameters of the reinforced-concrete shell and monitoring of their condition over time. This article presents an original concept for employing terrestrial laser scanning to conduct an end-to-end assessment of the geometric condition of a hyperboloid cooling tower as required by industry standards. The novelty of the proposed solution lies in the use of measurements of the interior of the structure to determine the actual thickness of the hyperboloid shell, which is generally disregarded in geometric measurements of such objects. The proposal involves several strategies and procedures for a reliable verification of the structure’s verticality, the detection of signs of ovalisation of the shell, the estimation of the parameters of the structure’s theoretical model, and the analysis of the distribution of the thickness and geometric imperfections of the reinforced-concrete shell. The idea behind the method for determining the actual thickness of the shell (including its variation due to repairs and reinforcement operations), which is generally disregarded when measuring the geometry of such structures, is to estimate the distance between point clouds of the internal and external surfaces of the structure using the M3C2 algorithm principle. As a particularly dangerous geometric anomaly of hyperboloid cooling towers, shell ovalisation is detected with an innovative analysis of the bimodality of the frequency distribution of radial deviations in horizontal cross-sections. The concept of a complete assessment of the geometry of a hyperboloid cooling tower was devised and validated using three measurement series of a structure that has been continuously in service for fifty years. The results are consistent with data found in design and service documents. We identified a permanent tilt of the structure’s axis to the northeast and geometric imperfections of the hyperboloid shell from −0.125 m to +0.136 m. The results also demonstrated no advancing deformation of the hyperboloid shell over a two-year research period, which is vital for its further use. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {3-Dimension (3D) printers are increasingly being used in high-tech industrial applications technology, because they can produce sophisticated products by laminating materials with less time and cost compared to cutting processing, such as conventional machine tools. However, since the reliability evaluation criteria and method for laminated manufacturing products are not clear, accidents cannot be prevented when 3D printed laminates are used as structures and machined parts. In this paper, ultrasonic wave propagation characteristics were evaluated on the specimens manufactured by laminating acrylonitrile butadiene styrene resin materials with a stereo lithography apparatus 3D printer using the ultrasonic inspection method among non-destructive techniques. Specimens were laminated in units of 0.1 mm, and thicknesses of 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 mm were applied as variables. In addition, the ultrasonic characteristics according to laminating direction were analyzed by laminating diagonally and vertically, including laminating in the horizontal direction, and defect specimens were produced to check whether defects were read. It was found that the ultrasonic velocity of the horizontally laminated specimen having a thickness of less than 4 mm was slower than the ultrasonic reference velocity, and that the ultrasonic velocity was affected according to the laminated direction. In addition, by arranging the defect location of the specimen differently, it was determined whether the defect was detected, and whether it was possible to check the location. Based on the results of this study, it will be possible to broadly apply this technique to advanced industrial technologies through evaluation of the condition and reliability of laminated manufacturing products manufactured with 3D printers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korean Society for Precision Engineering.},

	abstract = {In the realm of additive manufacturing, the quality and mechanical performance of 3D-printed structures are heavily influenced by the parametric settings used during the printing process. Some of these conditions include layer thickness, printing speed, infill density, filling pattern, printing substance, and so on. This research investigates the effect of printing factors on the strength characteristics of 3D-printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) as well as polylactic acid (PLA) structures. The parameters considered for the proposed study include material type, infill direction, infill density, and infill pattern. These four conditions are optimized using the machine-learning algorithm to obtain maximum strength in the resulting structures. The breaking load, extension, tensile strain, and tensile strength are the strength factors determined by the experiments. Furthermore, a deep neural network integrated with a walrus optimization algorithm (DNN-WOA)-based hybrid machine learning method is used in the experimental data to discover the optimal parametric conditions for constructing the structures with maximum strength. Based on the findings, infill density is a significant component in increasing both the tensile strength and elastic modulus of printed samples. Line and triangular-type infill patterns exerted the range of tensile strength with 10–20 MPa of deviations. In terms of tensile strain, the line pattern produced significantly more tensile strain than the triangle pattern. The highest breaking stress is observed at a 45∘ raster angle, regardless of infill density. When compared to the strengths of ABS and PLA, the PLA with a triangle infill pattern outperformed the ABS structure printed with a line-type infill pattern. The optimum printing settings for a PLA structure with a line-type infill pattern are 0∘ and 25% for raster angle and infill density, respectively. This parameter resulted in enhanced strength performance, with 45.81MPa of tensile strength, 12.13% of tensile strain, 359.34kgf of breaking load, 7.21mm of extension, and 24.12 min of printing time. © 2025 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Based on the traditional additive manufacturing, four-dimensional (4D) printing technology combines structure and shape memory effect (SME), which provides an effective way for the evolution of three-dimensional (3D) printing structure in shape, property and function. However, most of the current researches focus on the influence of printing process parameters on the mechanical properties of parts, and the actuation performance of hybrid conductive polymers is poor. Herein, a method combining 3D printing and coating is proposed to fabricate the electrothermal-responsive three-layer structural flexible actuator of paper-based Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) composites and polylactic acid (PLA) using 4D printing. The paper-based flexible layer is used as the support layer, the PLA layer made by 3D printing on one side of the paper-based layer is used as the active deformation layer, the MWCNTs/PEDOT:PSS conductive layer coated on the other side of the paper-based layer is used as the electrical actuation layer. The 4D deformation principle of the electrothermal-responsive flexible actuator was analyzed. The influence of printing parameters on the deformation angle of the flexible actuator was analyzed by orthogonal experiment. The experimental results show that the optimal printing parameters are the printing thickness of 0.1 mm, the printing speed of 50 mm s−1, the filling rate of 58%, and the substrate temperature of 60 °C. Under the optimal parameters, the fabricated three-layer structural flexible actuator of paper-based PEDOT:PSS/MWCNTs composites and PLA achieves a larger bending angle of 472.54° under a driving voltage of 25 V. Therefore, the prepared flexible actuator has excellent actuation performance. Moreover, the fabricated flexible actuators are applied in the fields of the flexible hand and the flexible manipulator, which demonstrates the great potential of the flexible actuator in the fields of human-computer interaction and flexible robot. © 2025 IOP Publishing Ltd.

	abstract = {The usage areas of plastic gear are increasing day by day because they are light, durable, easy to manufacture, and economical. Beveloid gears can operate on intersecting or divergent axes as well as parallel axes. Another important feature is that they are suitable for backlash adjustments with cross-cone angles like (+/-). The aim of this project is to classify beveloid gear quality tables via high-accuracy quality controls for gears made of plastic material (external-external and/or external/internal) with the involute profile. Minimum deviations and distortions are allowed in the profile and lead to providing the contact ratio performance values in the gears determined by the designer. Quality classification is carried out using traditional measurement methods on the profile and leads to straight beveloid gear internal and external gear made of plastic material in a 3D printer. The quality classification of cylindrical, worm, and bevel gear types is subject to classifications included in norms such as AGMA, ISO, and DIN. Since the general quality classification for plastic gear is in the low group, the minimum acceptance criteria for quality classification are cumulative pitch, single pitch deviation, and tooth thickness fluctuations are measured to define quality classification. When the quality inspection was made, tooth thickness variability was considered by using in-house software for Beveloid gear profiles. In-house software capabilities internal and external spur/helical beveloid gear profile generating considering linear and nonlinear profile shift. © 2023 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Among different manufacturing techniques available for composite aircraft structures, prepreg-based manual layup is widely used. During the fabrication process, the protective films of the prepregs or other materials used in the process could get inside as a foreign object between the layers. The present method of finding the inclusions during the prepreg layup is by visual inspection in the cleanroom. Carrying out visual inspection is challenging as the layup is usually carried out on large surfaces and reflective by nature. This paper proposes a 3D laser scanner-based approach for the detection of inclusion on flat and curved surfaces. Using the portable laser scanner, the surfaces of each layer are scanned and compared the resulting point clouds using with a reference layer data. Thicknesses between two surfaces are computed with Cloud to Cloud, Mesh to Cloud and Hausdorff distance to enhance the visibility of inclusions. It was found that this approach could enhance the visibility of inclusions over 50 micron and above. These enhanced features are used to train a multiview convolutional neural network to mark the inclusion regions, which can aid the inspector to identify the inclusion regions in a fast and efficient way. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Quality inspection of micro-holes is costly and redrilling defective holes can lead to imperfection owing to the misalignment in re-aligning the removed specimens.

Further, it explores the possibility of generalizing the models to 51 different scenarios of fabrication by classifying unseen data into 51 classes.

An additional 12 potential defect-prone conditions were designed to obtain data during conditional drilling. Hole quality was measured for each hole using OGP 3D profile microscope measuring machine.

Previously it was used mostly for defects indication. However, modern devices and software allow an application of a quantitative estimation of parameters of the defects. This contribution presents a novel infrared thermographic method for quantitative defect depth estimation. The majority of known thermographic techniques is based on a 1D heat transfer model and does not take into account 3D heat transfer. These methods are applicable only for large defects, which lateral size can be assumed as infinite. In contrast, the presented technique takes into account lateral dimension of defects and a finite thickness of a tested material. The method is based on a modification of the 1D analytical solution obtained by Almond et al. and a nonlinear optimization procedure. The algorithm was verified by numerical modelling and flash-pulse thermographic inspection experiments. Applicability of the method for the defect depth evaluation in the duraluminum parts was demonstrated. © METAL 2022. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing or 3D printing offers a fast and convenient way of fabricating parts. The additive manufacturing method can create not only complex (intricate) part structures (geometries), which are not possible or very expensive if using conventional subtractive manufacturing methods, but also to create parts with significantly less material's waste compared to conventional subtractive manufacturing methods, which is potentially an excellent benefit for the 3D-printed parts’ life-cycle assessment to be environmentally friendly. Stereolithography (SLA) is a promising method for creating parts for vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB), as SLA produces watertight and isotropic parts, unlike those made by as-printed fused filament fabrication (FFF) technology. Previous studies lack systematic investigation of material compatibility of SLA 3D-printed parts subjected to VRFB electrolyte or sulfuric acid. Herein, we tested the chemical compatibility, tensile mechanical strength, and swelling after immersion to 6.0 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solution, following ASTM D543 standard for testing the resistance of plastics to chemical reagents, as well as the watertightness of test specimens, which were 3D-printed from a feedstock of High-Temp-V2 resin (Formlabs, USA). We found no significant change in the material dimension, weight, and tensile strength between pristine and post-submerged specimens. In another experiment utilizing 1200 ml/min of VRFB electrolyte (51 % V3+ and 49 % V4+ + 2 mol L−1 H2SO4) on one side and 50 ml/min of de-ionized water (DI water) on the other side, we found the SLA 3D-printed part can withstand the pressure from the flowing liquids, and is watertight with no major leakage; however, we observed an increase in water conductivity (from 1.4 µS/cm to 8.4 µS/cm after 96 hours) due to small amount of H+ ion crossed through the 300-micrometer-thickness material, as evidenced from the pH increase of the DI water. Given the apparent slow rate of transfer (the ionic-conductivity increment is very low, which is four order-of-magnitude smaller compared to that of the VRFB electrolyte at 228.8 mS/cm), it would take significantly large timescales to detect the equilibrium concentration for both sides. Utilizing this study's valuable information for applying SLA 3D-printed material for VRFB systems, we demonstrated producing complex specialized / customized designs for VRFB, such as 3D-printed flow frame, 3D-printed bespoke sensor mounting, and 3D-printed customized tank. We also observed that translucent 3D-printed parts are useful for quick visual inspection of electrolyte flow for VRFB troubleshooting and diagnosis. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {3D ground-penetrating radar can realize rapid non-destructive detection of the structure interior compared with conventional inspection and has the advantages of high efficiency and high resolution, which has its unique advantages when applied to road inspection and disease identification. Since the setting of the parameters of the radar acquisition software has a large impact on the quality of disease mapping, it is necessary to carry out research on the optimal parameters of radar under different detection needs. In order to obtain the optimal parameter settings for the optimal 3D radar images under different working conditions, the best parameter settings under different detection demands are obtained through orthogonal tests using extreme difference analysis, with sampling spacing, dwell time and speed as factors, and information entropy and energy gradient as evaluation indexes, and by analyzing and evaluating the test results. The results show that the parameter settings for the best results of the data acquisition software vary greatly under different needs, and the parameter settings for the detection of internal road damage are 5cm sampling spacing, 2μs residence time, and the best image at a speed of 10km/h; and the recommended parameters for the thickness detection are 8cm sampling spacing, 2μs residence time, and the speed does not exceed the maximum speed limit. The results of this study provide theoretical and practical significance for the better application and promotion of ground-penetrating radar in road detection. © 2024 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Background: 3D printing (3DP) has enabled medical professionals to create patient-specific medical devices to assist in surgical planning. Anatomical models can be generated from patient scans using a wide array of software, but there are limited studies on the geometric variance that is introduced during the digital conversion of images to models. The final accuracy of the 3D printed model is a function of manufacturing hardware quality control and the variability introduced during the multiple digital steps that convert patient scans to a printable format. This study provides a brief summary of common algorithms used for segmentation and refinement. Parameters for each that can introduce geometric variability are also identified. Several metrics for measuring variability between models and validating processes are explored and assessed. Methods: Using a clinical maxillofacial CT scan of a patient with a tumor of the mandible, four segmentation and refinement workflows were processed using four software packages. Differences in segmentation were calculated using several techniques including volumetric, surface, linear, global, and local measurements. Results: Visual inspection of print-ready models showed distinct differences in the thickness of the medial wall of the mandible adjacent to the tumor. Volumetric intersections and heatmaps provided useful local metrics of mismatch or variance between models made by different workflows. They also allowed calculations of aggregate percentage agreement and disagreement which provided a global benchmark metric. For the relevant regions of interest (ROIs), statistically significant differences were found in the volume and surface area comparisons for the final mandible and tumor models, as well as between measurements of the nerve central path. As with all clinical use cases, statistically significant results must be weighed against the clinical significance of any deviations found. Conclusions: Statistically significant geometric variations from differences in segmentation and refinement algorithms can be introduced into patient-specific models. No single metric was able to capture the true accuracy of the final models. However, a combination of global and local measurements provided an understanding of important geometric variations. The clinical implications of each geometric variation is different for each anatomical location and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by clinicians familiar with the process. Understanding the basic segmentation and refinement functions of software is essential for sites to create a baseline from which to evaluate their standard workflows, user training, and inter-user variability when using patient-specific models for clinical interventions or decisions. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The key components of the fully mechanized mining equipment are severely worn during the operation of the equipment, resulting in equipment failure and large economic losses. The new wear-resistant composite material has excellent wear resistance and strength. The use of it in the key components of the equipment can effectively increase the service life of the coal mining equipment components, thereby reducing the cost in the coal mining process. Therefore, the research on the key application technology of new wear-resistant composite material had important practical value. Composite casting technology was a common combination technology of composite materials and mechanical parts. The key of the composite casting method to prepare parts is whether the clad metal and the composite material can be combined stably. The key to the stable combination of the two was whether the interface between the two was stable. Therefore, the study of the interface between the two has important theoretical significance. In this paper, vacuum sintering method was used to prepare zirconia toughened alumina iron matrix (ZTAp-Fe) composite. The metal matrix material was iron-based self-fluxing alloy powder with an average particle size of 50 μm, ZTA particles with an average particle size of 2 mm were selected as the reinforcing phase. And the QM-3SP4 planetary ball mill was used for mixing, PP-100S full-automatic tablet press was used to press the mixed powder into a green body, and the green body was placed in ZT-40-20 vacuum carbon tube sintering furnace for vacuum sintering, then, the Japanese Rigaku company type D/mas-250p X-ray diffractometer (XRD) was used to analyze the phase composition of ZTAp-Fe composite. In the composite casting experiment, the pouring temperature was 1650 ℃, ZTAp-Fe composite size was 100 mm×67 mm×40 mm, the casting size was 100 mm×67 mm×40 mm, and the sand mold material was industrial water, the size of glass sand and sand mould was 300 mm×210 mm×160 mm. ProCAST software was used to perform composite casting numerical simulation, including the entire process of filling and solidification in the composite casting process. The 3D modeling software UG was used to create the model, the size of the model was the same as the actual casting size, and the created 3D model was imported into the Procast software. The model was checked and the mesh was divided in the Mesh module. The parameters in the Cast module were set as follows: the initial temperature was 25 ℃, the pouring temperature was 1650 ℃, and the filling time was 10 min. Finally, the numerical simulation was completed and viewed in the Viewer module. The simulation results showed that, the surface temperature change and internal temperature field distribution of ZTAp-Fe composite in the composite casting were investigated through the finite element simulation, the microscopic observation and element analysis of the interface between the cladding of the casting material and the preform were carried out to explore ZTAp-Fe composite. The interface of ZTAp-Fe composite casting sample was studied by the method of combining theoretical simulation calculation and experiment. X-ray inspection results showed that the phase composition of ZTAp-Fe composite was α-(Fe-Cr-Ni), FeCrB, Cr7C3, Al2O3 and ZrO2. Among them, α-(Fe-Cr-Ni), FeCrB and Cr7C3 were the main phases of iron-based alloys, and Al2O3 and ZrO2 were the main phases of ZTAp. The numerical simulation results of composite casting showed that the surface temperature field of ZTAp-Fe composite was uniformly distributed during the whole process of composite casting, and the maximum temperature exceeded the liquidus temperature of ZTAp-Fe composite for a period of time. Observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), it was found that the interface between the coated metal and ZTAp-Fe composite was well bonded, and there was no obvious defect. Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) result showed that the element distribution at the interface was uniform. During the vacuum sintering process, ZTAp did not chemically react with other raw materials to generate new phases. After sintering, ZTAp was subjected to compressive stress, and the iron matrix was subjected to tensile stress, forming thermal expansion dislocation strengthening. The finite element numerical simulation calculation of the surface temperature change and the internal temperature field distribution of ZTAp-Fe composite showed that ZTAp-Fe composite matrix and coating could be fused. When the pouring temperature was 1650 ℃, the composite casting was performed. The interface between ZTAp-Fe composite and the cladding layer was well bonded, and the thickness of the interface transition layer was about 10 μm. The elements at the interface between ZTAp-Fe composite and the cladding layer diffused each other to form a metallurgical bond. © 2022, Youke Publishing Co., Ltd. All right reserved.},

	abstract = {3D measurement techniques have permeated sectors like intelligent manufacturing and online inspection, demanding higher real-time performance in industrial applications. Recently, deep-learning-based profilometry (DLP) has gained significant attention due to the powerful feature extraction capabilities of convolutional neural networks, enabling single-shot projection to meet both real-time and robustness requirements in dynamic measurement scenarios. However, while these methods yield promising results, they predominantly emphasize model improvements (e.g., optimizing module functionality or expanding network parameters) often neglecting the parallel integration with traditional physical models and the optimization of input features. To overcome these limitations, a novel DLP that combines parallel phase-shifting theory with a fringe restoration network has been proposed and leverages a high-quality dataset, balancing the trade-offs between projection efficiency and reconstruction accuracy: (1) A learning-based spatial composite phase-shifting profilometry (LSCPP) is proposed, marking the first application of equal thickness interference theory from digital holography to DLP. This mitigates pixel loss caused by frequency-domain filtering in FTP while ensuring high-precision fringe reconstruction without auxiliary templates; (2) A multi-exposure dataset is constructed, accompanied by the introduction of a novel evaluation metric, modulation error rate (MER), for performance assessment; (3) Extensive experiments are conducted across both static and dynamic scenarios, utilizing multi-exposure and public datasets, and are compared with state-of-the-art DLPs. It demonstrates the proposed LSCPP's real-time capability and generalization performance in dynamic measurement environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Remanufacturing is an industrial process of turning used products into products with the same quality as new ones. Of the processes comprising remanufacturing, the repair process poses the greatest challenge. Additive manufacturing (AM) is expected to bring innovation to the repair process of remanufacturing. Although, so far, the directed energy deposition (DED) type AM has been most frequently applied to remanufacturing and only a few studies applied powder bed fusion (PBF) type AM to remanufacturing, PBF demonstrates great potential for application in remanufacturing. This study aims to assess the feasibility of the application of PBF to remanufacturing. We conducted an experimental PBF-based repair and attempted to identify its challenges. In the experiment, 1) we used AlSi10Mg powder, 2) we first fabricated a 5 mm square cube sample by using PBF, 3) we next removed 0.4 mm of thickness from the sample with milling, 4) then we restored 0.44 mm of thickness using PBF, and 5) we observed the restored sample. The observation showed that: 1) misalignment in the restoration occurred, 2) keyhole defects and gas pores were found more in the boundary area between the original and restored parts, and 3) the microstructures showed polycrystals in the restored part. These factors impaired the quality and reliability of PBF-based repair and present challenges of enhancing the feasibility of applying PBF-based repair to remanufacturing. This study also examined the whole process of PBFbased remanufacturing, which includes not only the repair process but also the processes of component inspection, process design, pre-repair process, and postrepair process, and discussed the challenges in these processes. The challenges include the development of repair process design methods, supportless fabrication processes, and non-destructive test (NDT) techniques. © Fuji Technology Press Ltd.},

Owing to its unique potential for fast production rates, and capacity of creating complex shapes, the number of researches on AM techniques have increased day by day in the technical literature. In this work, contrary to common literature efforts focused on mechanical properties, friction and wear behaviors of additively manufactured PETG samples were analyzed experimentally. As a methodology, fused filament fabrication (FFF) was selected. In order to explore the influence of manufacturing factors on wear properties, layer thickness (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mm), infill rate (40, 60, 80, and 100%), and building direction (vertical and horizontal) were changed. Before the friction tests, dimensional accuracy, hardness, and surface roughness measurements were conducted to interpret better the wear results. In addition, macroscopic and microscopic inspections were performed to determine the correct reason behind the deformation. From the data collected during the tests, there was a positive interaction between volume loss and layer thickness. Besides, there was no direct interaction between infill rate/building direction and coefficient of friction. In comparison with vertically built samples, horizontally built samples were subjected to more plastic deformation, and their worn surfaces were severely damaged.  © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {Cumulative second harmonic Lamb waves in nonlinear media feature increasing amplitudes with propagation distance, conducive to the monitoring of material microstructural changes in structures. The phenomenon can be readily generated by zero-order symmetric (S0) mode waves in the low-frequency range. However, in a practical piezoelectric-transducer-activated system, both S0 and A0 (zero-order antisymmetric) mode Lamb waves are inevitably excited, while only the former is responsible for cumulative effects. The generation efficiency of the cumulative second harmonics is then affected by the presence of the A0 waves. To tackle the problem, this study develops a metamaterial structure, referred to as a meta-structure, to tactically enhance the cumulative second harmonic S0 Lamb waves by converting the A0 mode components into S0 mode waves. Topology optimization is conducted to design the meta-structure, which is surface-mounted onto the structure under inspection, to achieve high-efficiency A0-to-S0 wave mode conversion. Through tuning the parameters and constraints of the optimization, the designed single-sided meta-structure breaks the structural symmetry in the thickness direction, while facilitating its practical implementation. Typical scenarios with different meta-structure materials are discussed. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the strain amplitudes of the fundamental S0 mode waves can be increased by 60% with the deployment of the meta-structure, alongside an enhancement of the second harmonic S0 mode waves at different sensing distances. Finally, the designed meta-structure is fabricated via 3D printing technique and tested experimentally on an aluminum plate subjected to thermal aging treatment for monitoring the heating-induced microstructural changes inside the structure. Experimental results confirm an increase in the wave amplitudes of the linear S0 mode waves with the assistance of the meta-structure. The developed system improves the sensitivity of nonlinear Lamb wave-based monitoring methods in characterizing material microstructural changes, which shows great promise for detecting incipient damage in practical structural health monitoring applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Bolt detection is an essential part of the train inspection system. This paper presents a novel method of wear and looseness detection of the bolt on the subway, based on the depth and intensity maps captured by a 3D line-scan camera. First, this paper adopts the aggregate channel features algorithm to locate bolts by two steps on the intensity map. Second, by combining the seeded region growing and the random sample consensus algorithm(RANSAC), the method achieves region segmentation in complex environments. RANSAC fits the plane of upper and lower surfaces of the bolt. The difference between the average depth values of inliers with the twice RANSAC is defined as the nut thickness. Third, the wear and looseness detection is realized by comparing it with the historical data. Finally, the 3D image is reconstructed to facilitate human observation. Algorithm verification has been carried out on different trains and locations of bolts. In dynamic operation, the detection success rate is above 94.44%. The relative detection error of the same vehicle with the latest data is within 0.3mm, proving the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed detection scheme. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the production of advanced thermoplastic composite parts using conventional automated processing routes, critical issues can arise, such as the uniform heating of blanks of varying thickness, inhomogeneous temperature loss of hot preforms during transport, or challenges in handling and accurate positioning of them prior to the forming step. This work presents an alternative manufacturing approach in which infrared (IR) heating and the transport process of a hot preform are eliminated. In this method, a geometrically calibrated composite part is manufactured directly from a spot-welded tailored ply stack by combining heating, forming, and consolidation within a single processing unit. The manufacturing concept, referred to as 3D-consolidation, was implemented on a force-controlled consolidation production cell using a specially developed tooling solution. Instrumented experimental production trials were performed on an aerodynamic, aviation-specific component geometry produced with a tailored laminate architecture using a carbon fiber-reinforced thermoplastic unidirectional (UD) tape material based on a low-melt polyaryletherketone polymer matrix (CF/LMPAEK). The potential of the manufacturing approach was demonstrated through process data analysis and visual inspection of the fabricated composite parts. As the results show, near-net-shape manufacturing is provided, including a proper representation of the part's filigree edge sections and a regular internal laminate structure. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc..

	abstract = {Use of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite in structural and aerospace fields is often restricted in a heated service condition. The thermal-induced degradation of FRP can be complicated by the internal defects with geometrical irregularities. This highlights the need for new characterization methods capable of revealing the thermal conduction process of FRP with different types of defects. To this end, the present study establishes a state-of-the-art methodology, namely micro computed tomography based finite element analysis (μCT-based FEA), for evaluating the influence of internal defects on the thermal conductivity of FRP. The modelling work through μCT gains an insight into the actual three-dimensional (3D) meso-scale structures for various species of defects (void, needle-like cavity, air pocket/unfilled bug hole, and delamination) in FRP. From the numerical ‘virtual’ experiments, the simulated through-thickness thermal conductivities range from 0.2196 to 0.2270 W/(m·K), which are comparable with the experimental data from literature. The investigation also discovers that the unfilled bug hole and delamination decrease the effective thermal conductivity of FRP, while these defects can cause sub-surface heat concentration. In contrast, the needle-like cavity has negligible effect on the through-thickness thermal conductivity. Increasing the water saturation degree of defects leads to an exponential increase in the thermal conductivity of FRP, especially when a large air cavity or delamination is incorporated into the composite. Based on transient analysis, the relationship among temperature, heat flux intensity and exposure time is numerically determined. The research findings can motivate the applications of μCT-based FEA in quality inspection/control of manufactured polymer composite products and even in improving the thermal non-destructive testing methods for defect detection of field composite structures. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Ultrasonic inspection is an environmentally friendly and easily deployable nondestructive testing (NDT) method widely used for defect detection of critical components in the industry. Phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) is one of the most advanced ultrasonic inspection methods, which gives volume inspection with increased resolution and coverage, improving inspection efficiency. Because of the weld structure echoes and the abstract nature of ultrasound images, especially facing meters and feature-changing weld joints with different thicknesses and welding methods in shipbuilding, the analysis of the PAUT weld data still relies on experienced rater random inspections. Rating complex welded products process is lengthy, costly, and prone to introduce human error during the manual rating but challenges automatic detection. To automatically segment defects in PAUT data, this work shows a combination of PAUT data of ship weld and three-dimensional (3D) U-net architecture. Combining PAUT imaging principles with welding and scan processes, a PAUT volumetric image dataset, including different thicknesses and scan angles, is established. We pioneered the application of 3D U-net architecture to segment defects in PAUT volume data. We found that U-net architecture with two encoding stages will perform better in segmenting defects in PAUT data, and region-based loss mainly improves the accuracy. Furthermore, a lightweight U-net architecture containing skip-connection and residual blocks is proposed with precision and efficiency improvement. The validation results show that the proposed U-net architecture offers a feasible solution to the problem of segmenting defects from PAUT data with a Dice accuracy of 90.9 %. Segmentation results help to locate and measure defects. This method makes locating and sizing defects in PAUT weld data possible within a fraction of a second. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Medical ultrasound (US) system quality assurance (QA) is employed only modestly by users because of the large number of variables recommended for measurement and the relatively low use of all that information when it is acquired. By 2011 it was again clear that the equipment was not as reliable as often contended; that failures were mainly transducer, cable, and visible mechanical effects, easily addressed by uniformity tests and visual inspections. Monitor degradation also became more widely recognized. Recently it was proposed that system imaging performance QA could be accomplished by simple, cine loop acquisitions with a random hypoechoic sphere phantom (RHSP). With automated analysis, this should detect almost all B mode image quality difficulties and sources of most defects in other modes. The measures, based on the spheres' mean lesion signal-to-noise ratios (LSNRms), also would be absolute tests in 3D and valid for acceptance testing and comparisons, providing intuitive results for users to anticipate a transducer's utility in various depths and applications. This challenge to traditional phantoms has stimulated improvement in more traditional polymer filament or wire phantoms, making it easier to see poor slice thickness, but with considerable acquisition effort and cost. Purpose: To evaluate the potential and ease of use of the commercially available RHSPs, we compared them with a new wire phantom and an established uniformity phantom for detecting physically simulated, common transducer defects, using commercially available automated analysis. Methods: The three types of transducer defects were simulated physically for comparison with the same, undisrupted, transducer. A layer of Styrofoam was taped over either one end of the array, one side of the array, one part of one side of the array, or not at all, essentially blocking all of the elements on one end or one side, or just part of the elevational extent of the involved elements. Scanning methods and analysis, generally described in IEC TS62736, provided median lesion signal-to-noise ratio (LSNRm) and clarity index (Ci) on the spheres, −6 dB pulse-echo response widths on the wires and median signal level on the uniformity phantom and RHSP. Several defective transducers were evaluated as well. Results: The RHSP phantom/analysis gave consistent results, with delineation of the lateral and the full elevational disruptions, but only meager delineation of the partial elevational disruption given chosen settings. Beam width measurements on the 90°/45° wire phantom delineated all three disruptions but were more difficult to perform and function over limited settings. The uniformity measurements revealed only the lateral disruption. Conclusions: The RHSP phantom is now available at a considerably lower cost than wire-based phantoms. It demonstrated good detection of all but the subtlest disruption. We preliminarily recommend this phantom for US system user QA and performance evaluation, after initial verification on each model of the system of the grayscale characteristic curve and spatial measurements. Quantitative expectations for different US systems will develop rapidly, as more users will be implementing this simpler QA. Software or phantom modifications can add evaluation of spatial measurements. © 2025 The Author(s).

	abstract = {In order to ensure high weld qualities and structural integrity of engineering structures, it is crucial to detect areas of high stress concentrations along weld seams. Traditional inspection methods rely on visual inspection and manual weld geometry measurements. Recent advances in the field of automated measurement techniques allow virtually unrestricted numbers of inspections by laser measurements of weld profiles; however, in order to compare weld qualities of different welding processes and manufacturers, a deeper understanding of statistical distributions of stress concentrations along weld seams is required. Hence, this study presents an approach to statistically characterize different types of butt joint weld seams. For this purpose, an artificial neural network is created from 945 finite element simulations to determine stress concentration factors at butt joints. Besides higher quality of predictions compared to empirical estimation functions, the new approach can directly be applied to all types welded structures, including arc-and laser-welded butt joints, and coupled with all types of 3D-measurement devices. Furthermore, sheet thickness ranging from 1 mm to 100 mm can be assessed. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The use of Pipeline Inspection Gauges (PIGs) to clean the pipes and understand the exact location of existing pipes is essential to protect them from damage during operation. In-depth study of the most important component sealing disc is a new method to solve the failure of the current PIG in the working process. This study focuses on redesigning the sealing disc in combination with soft robot drive technology. First, the structure of a new multi-airbag sealing disc is composed of a conventional sealing disc and a plurality of airbags located above it. Then, the multi-airbag sealing disc was successfully fabricated by using 3D printing technology and multi-step molding, and finally the active control of the multi-airbag sealing disc was realized by inflating the airbag. For the newly designed multi-airbag sealing disc, the most important concern is the bending angle β of the sealing disc and the expansion ratio η of the airbag. Numerical and experimental results were compared to verify the accuracy of the numerical method. Based on this method, the effects of the position of the airbag, the height rate, and the thickness rate on the bending angle of the multi-airbag sealing disc and the expansion ratio of the airbag were studied. The results show that at a given air pressure, the position of the airbag does not substantially affect the expansion ratio of the airbag itself, and the smaller the distance between the airbag and the outer edge of the sealing disc, the easier it is to bend the sealing disc.

	abstract = {In this paper, we tackle the task of replacing labor intensive and repetitive manual inspection of sprayed concrete elements with a sensor-based and automated alternative. We present a geometric feedback system that is integrated within a robotic setup and includes a set of depth cameras used for acquiring data on sprayed concrete structures, during and after fabrication. The acquired data are analyzed in terms of thickness and surface quality, with both sets of information then used within the adaptive fabrication process. The thickness evaluation is based on the comparison of the as-built state to a previous as-built state or to the design model. The surface quality evaluation is based on the local analysis of 3D geometric and intensity features. These features are used by a random forest classifier trained using data manually labelled by a skilled professional. With this approach, we are able to achieve a prediction accuracy of 87 % or better when distinguishing different surface quality types on flat specimens, and 75 % when applied in a full production setting with wet and non-planar surfaces. The presented approach is a contribution towards in-line material thickness and surface quality inspection within digital fabrication. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In the continuously growing field of dielectric elastomers (DE) research is increasingly focusing on promising new production technologies with regard to reproducibility and flexibility. Challenges in production remain, especially the handling of thin elastomer films and applying the covering electrodes, which are in the range of several 10 and single-digit micrometers, respectively. Various fabrication processes, e.g. spin coating, blade casting, or sequential assembly of prefabricated elastomer films have so far been applied. Direct ink writing (DIW), or more precisely robocasting, is presented in this work for applying the elastomer layer. It is based on the extrusion of liquid elastomer in a wide viscosity range. This contribution presents printing of the elastomer layers by a DIW printer and evaluates the printing technology in terms of a fabrication method for dielectric elastomer transducers (DET). The requirements for 3D printing of DET are a homogeneous layer structure with low variation of the layer thickness, dimensional stability, and the avoidance of air inclusions. Considering these requirements, printing tests are conducted with the two-component silicone rubber ELASTOSIL RT 625 (Wacker Chemie AG, Germany). Elastomer layers are printed by varying the printing parameters, such as, the nozzle geometry and the printing speed. An optical inspection is implemented both to optimize the printing and to evaluate the result. In line with these objectives, the proposed process is evaluated by measuring the layer thickness and analyzing images of the printed elastomer layers. A minimum thickness for a single layer of approximately 40 µm was achieved. © 2022 SPIE.},

	abstract = {Adhesively bonded Polymeric Matrix Composite (PMC) structures could offer significant cost savings and increase production rates in the fabrication and assembly of future composite airframes. In particular, bonded PMCs may eliminate the use of thousands of mechanical fasteners and allow incorporation of multiple aircraft composite primary structures into a unitized structural design. However, increased susceptibility to defects and manufacturing irregularities, including voids, disbonds, and geometry variations, as well as complex interacting failure mechanisms, hinder a widespread use of bonded PMCs. Inherent susceptibility to manufacturing defects contributes to higher variability of part quality than found in structures manufactured using fasteners. The presence of microstructural defects at critical locations may significantly reduce strength and useful life of adhesively bonded structures. At the same time, existing methods for simulation of the performance of bonded PMCs are based on homogenization and similitude of material response and an incomplete physical understanding of the failure processes involved. Such approaches have proven unable to capture the effects of defects on structural performance and explain large data scatter commonly observed. Hence, these methods do not provide the level of confidence needed for qualification and certification of bonded interfaces. Certification of adhesively bonded interfaces currently used in primary aircraft PMC structures requires installation of fasteners to produce a redundant load path. This redundancy greatly increases production time and expense, and requires additional inspection and sealing. The need to develop a high-fidelity computational materials-based capability to support next-generation qualification and certification of bonded PMCs and safely reduce redundant fasteners has been identified under NASA Transformational Tools and Technologies (TTT) program. As part of such effort, this work presents the current work- in-progress towards the development of an integrated methodology to enable improved understanding of the failure mechanisms that govern performance along a bonded PMC interface in presence of manufacturing defects. The approach is envisioned to integrate (1) accurate 3D measurement of bondline defects and irregularities, including X- ray Computed Tomography (CT) data; (2) allow for input of material properties from experimental evaluation meeting the material input data requirements; and (3) conduct a finite element-based progressive damage and failure analysis (PDFA) capturing the multiple damage modes and their interaction at the bonded interface, and predicting the structural behavior. Due to the observed effects of defects location, size and shape upon structural behavior, the proposed numerical approach considers a finite element (FE) model where the adhesive layer is discretized at the sub- bondline thickness level using a solid layer of continuum elements and incorporates discrete representations of the critical defects. Preliminary results are presented using a continuum description of the adhesive material in combination with the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) for prediction of cohesive failure within the adhesive. The approach is implemented in commercial FE software Abaqus for simulation of bondline fracture in adhesively bonded mode I Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) PMCs specimens. © 2023, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This tool is widely used in the semiconductor industry for metrology CD measurements and is one of the most common inspection methods. The CDSEM tool ZX has advanced techniques that not only measure line width but also build a 3D model of the scan. The CDSEM tool measures the sidewall angle by determining the top and bottom positions of the photomask pattern, and using the data obtained from these positions, the distance of the horizontal and vertical can be calculated. These data are then used in an algorithmic equation to simulate the slope value and calculate the sidewall angle. To verify the correctness of the sidewall angle value obtained through CDSEM measurements, TEM (transmission electron microscopy) is used. TEM is an intuitive method that uses a high-energy electron beam to capture high-resolution cross-sectional images of larger materials such as photomasks. TEM is a common method for analyzing the sidewall angle and thickness of thin films and is widely used in material science and nanotechnology. However, TEM's cross-section implementation is a destructive method and is not an ideal method for testing product photomasks. In this study, the simulated data from CDSEM and actual cross-sectional data from TEM are collected and integrated for cross-comparison to obtain the corresponding relationship. © 2023 SPIE.},

	abstract = {The rebar installation quality significantly impacts the safety and durability of reinforced concrete (RC) structures. Traditional manual inspection is time-consuming, inefficient, and highly subjective. In order to solve this problem, this study uses a depth camera and aims to develop an intelligent inspection method for the rebar installation quality of an RC slab. The Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) method is used to extract point cloud data for the bottom formwork, the upper and lower rebar lattices, and individual rebars. These data are utilized to measure the concrete cover thickness, the distance between the upper and lower rebar lattices, and the spacing between rebars in the RC slab. This paper introduces the concept of the “diameter calculation region” and combines point cloud semantic information with rebar segmentation mask information through the relationship between pixel coordinates and camera coordinates to measure the nominal diameter of the rebar. The verification results indicate that the maximum deviations for the concrete cover thickness, the distance between the upper and lower rebar lattices, and the spacing of the double-layer bidirectional rebar in the RC slab are 0.41 mm, 1.32 mm, and 5 mm, respectively. The accuracy of the nominal rebar diameter measurement reaches 98.4%, demonstrating high precision and applicability for quality inspection during the actual construction stage. Overall, this study integrates computer vision into traditional civil engineering research, utilizing depth cameras to acquire point cloud data and color results. It replaces inefficient manual inspection methods with an intelligent and efficient approach, addressing the challenge of detecting double-layer reinforcement. This has significant implications for practical engineering applications and the development of intelligent engineering monitoring systems. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The gradual growth of oxides inside thermal barrier coatings is a key factor leading to the degradation of thermal barrier coating performance until its failure, and accurate monitoring of the growth stress during this process is crucial to ensure the long-term stable operation of engines. In this study, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy was introduced as a new method to characterize the growth stress in thermal barrier coatings. By combining metallographic analysis and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation techniques, the real microstructure of the oxide layer was obtained, and an accurate simulation model of the oxide growth was constructed on this basis. The elastic solutions of the thermally grown oxide layer of thermal insulation coatings were obtained by using the controlling equations in the rate-independent theoretical model, and the influence of the thickness of the thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer on the stress distribution was explored. Based on experimental data, multidimensional 3D numerical models of thermal barrier coatings with different TGO thicknesses were constructed, and the terahertz time-domain responses of oxide coatings with different thicknesses were simulated using the time-domain finite difference method to simulate the actual inspection scenarios. During the simulation process, white noise with signal-to-noise ratios of 10 dB to 20 dB was embedded to approximate the actual detection environment. After adding the noise, wavelet transform (WT) was used to reduce the noise in the data. The results showed that the wavelet transform had excellent noise reduction performance. For the problems due to the large data volume and small sample data after noise reduction, local linear embedding (LLE) and kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM) were used, respectively, and the kernel function was optimized using the gray wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm to improve the model’s immunity to interference. Experimental validation showed that the proposed LLE-GWO-KELM hybrid model performed well in predicting the TGO growth stress of thermal insulation coatings. In this study, a novel, efficient, nondestructive, online, and high-precision measurement method for the growth in TGO stress of thermal barrier coatings was developed, which provides reliable technical support for evaluating the service life of thermal barrier coatings. © 2025 by the authors.},

The changes in mechanical structure via flexural bending and cracking can be detected by monitoring the deviations in electrical impedance signals recorded with embedded PZT sensors. This paper has conducted a comprehensive study on the potential of an EMI technique with embedded PZT sensors with 3D Concrete Printing (3DCP) structures subjected to flexural bending test until plastic failure. The impact of different Piezoelectric housing methods and materials has been studied comprehensively through the monitoring of EMI signals. Experimental results indicate that material housing types and thickness affect the sensitivity of EMI readings but also performed as a reinforcement when a load is directly applied. The embedded PZT sensors with the EMI technique have shown strong potential to address the cost and lifecycle challenges posed by traditional construction methods as the insertion of PZT sensors seamlessly functions with 3DCP workflows. Further developmental work can be carried out to address the sensitivity of the sensor, performance as a reinforcement, and installation automation. The results proved that the coated sensors could detect fractures in 3DCP concrete with decreased sensitivity on thicker coating layers through the variance in materials and coating thickness in the paper. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: In vitro fertilization (IVF) has emerged as a transformative solution for infertility. However, achieving favorable live-birth outcomes remains challenging. Current clinical IVF practices in IVF involve the collection of heterogeneous embryo data through diverse methods, including static images and temporal videos. However, traditional embryo selection methods, primarily reliant on visual inspection of morphology, exhibit variability and are contingent on the experience of practitioners. Therefore, an automated system that can evaluate heterogeneous embryo data to predict the final outcomes of live births is highly desirable. Methods: We employed artificial intelligence (AI) for embryo morphological grading, blastocyst embryo selection, aneuploidy prediction, and final live-birth outcome prediction. We developed and validated the AI models using multitask learning for embryo morphological assessment, including pronucleus type on day 1 and the number of blastomeres, asymmetry, and fragmentation of blastomeres on day 3, using 19,201 embryo photographs from 8271 patients. A neural network was trained on embryo and clinical metadata to identify good-quality embryos for implantation on day 3 or day 5, and predict live-birth outcomes. Additionally, a 3D convolutional neural network was trained on 418 time-lapse videos of preimplantation genetic testing (PGT)-based ploidy outcomes for the prediction of aneuploidy and consequent live-birth outcomes. Results: These two approaches enabled us to automatically assess the implantation potential. By combining embryo and maternal metrics in an ensemble AI model, we evaluated live-birth outcomes in a prospective cohort that achieved higher accuracy than experienced embryologists (46.1% vs. 30.7% on day 3, 55.0% vs. 40.7% on day 5). Our results demonstrate the potential for AI-based selection of embryos based on characteristics beyond the observational abilities of human clinicians (area under the curve: 0.769, 95% confidence interval: 0.709-0.820).

	abstract = {Featured Application: Through the use of high-precision 3D virtual reconstruction techniques, together with comparison algorithms, this study is a clear advance in the field of building execution and, more specifically, in the prevention of occupational risks during the said process from the point of view of its management, inspection, evaluation, and control. It is about introducing high-precision 3D reconstruction technologies, which, when applied during the execution of construction projects, allow better monitoring. These 3D reconstructions are generated through terrestrial laser scanner records in different phases of the work, capturing processes and operators with simultaneous activity and their possible interferences and thus associated risks. With this, the responsible agents can evaluate the prevention strategies to follow and choose the most appropriate ones. On the other hand, this 3D virtual technology allows construction managers to analyze the model with the aim of improving quality standards in construction, being able to determine very precise and detailed data of the work in each phase without the need to be in the same. The findings remind project managers of the advantages of these technologies to make their work easier, especially in cases of project complexity, uncertainty in the dating and available information, and interactions between different operators. In the intelligent manufacturing process and digitization, new research spaces have been created, such as reverse engineering and its use for the detection of risks in construction. For this reason, in this research, an analysis methodology is proposed that, through terrestrial laser scanner records in different phases of the work, allows for an analysis and evaluation of the identification of security risks. In addition, by capturing different processes, it can be determined not only interferences from different operators that can generate risk but also establish quality standards in construction, such as determining the thicknesses of the coating of the concrete manufactured “in situ”. Therefore, this research responds to quality analysis in the material execution of the activity and construction of formwork systems and their safety, as well as defining the location of the static and dynamic elements of the model. This value of the morphometric parameter of the building and the scene to be represented characterizes the morphometrics of the work execution activities and finally evaluates the semantic information model of the BIM construction, in which the deformations between the ideal model and what was executed. With the results of this study, it can be concluded that the latest 3D model reconstruction techniques (BIM), together with comparison algorithms, can determine millimeter precision, and with that, it can establish a better method for inspection, evaluation, and control through non-destructive technology. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Adult bone age assessment is an important part of forensic anthropological age assessment, which includes items such as adult living body bone age assessment, unknown cadaver bone age assessment, and ossified cadaver bone age assessment. Traditional assessment methods are mainly applicable to unknown and ossified cadavers. Adult living body age assessment requires extracting high-definition models of pelvic volume reconstruction (VR), and then referring to traditional methods for assessment. The purpose of this study is to explore the necessary conditions for establishing a high-definition model extraction method for pelvic volume reconstruction, which solves the problem of setting parameters for multi-slice spiral CT (MSCT) scanning and reconstruction in the process of pelvic 3D imaging sampling for adult bone age assessment. This study used Precision32 (Kaiying Company) MSCT with protocol fixed tube voltage of 120 kV, tube current of 250 mA, pitch of 1.05, layer thickness of 1.1 mm, spacing of 0.8 mm, and matrix 512 × 512 to scan fresh corpse pelvis, and adjust reconstruction parameters such as filtering, layer thickness, layer spacing, matrix, etc. to compare the clarity of pelvic volume reconstruction images, and select the necessary parameter values. The research results indicate that filtering, layer thickness, layer spacing, matrix, etc. have a significant impact on the clarity of volume reconstruction images. Choosing pelvic filtering, thin layer thickness, short layer spacing, and large matrix can improve the clarity of pelvic VR models. Therefore, under the premise of using scanning parameters such as protocol tube voltage and tube current, it’s necessary to choose pelvic filtering, thin layer thickness, short layer spacing, large matrix, etc. to establish a high-definition model for pelvic volume reconstruction. © 2024, Editorial Office of Forensic Science and Technology.

	abstract = {Corrosion is a prevalent damage aspect of aged highway bridges. In case of steel viaducts, the phenomenon is more intense close to the support due to malfunctioning expansion joints which fail to prevent water from penetrating into the supersaturate level. Engineers, to ensure public safety, estimate the load bearing capacity of deteriorated bridges by performing thickness measurements along the corroded girders. Established data collection methods are highly dependent on inspectors judgment and they are characterized by measurements short comings. To address these weaknesses, this study explores the use of 3D scanning for the capacity evaluation of damaged beams. Field corroded girders are scanned in the laboratory, and contours maps are created as an approach for mapping the remaining material of corroded parts of the girder. The performance of the proposed methodology is validated with thickness measurements taken by an ultrasonic thickness gauge as well as with full scale experimental testing of a field corroded girder. The post processed point clouds are combined with finite element modeling of the tested girder as well as with closed form equations to examine whether point clouds data can inform these two tools reasonably for accurate capacity predictions. The emerging conclusion is that 3D scanning can be a valuable tool for future modernization of the current inspection techniques towards a more detailed and efficient inspection protocol. © 2022 the Author(s).},

	abstract = {Significance Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is considered to be the most promising technology for fabricating technology nodes of 7 nm and below in high volume manufacturing (HVM). Due to the shrinkage of semiconductor device features and the increase in process complexity, achieving an acceptable yield is challenging. Edge placement error (EPE) quantifies the pattern fidelity of a device structure created in a multi-patterning scheme. It is urgent to reduce EPE to guarantee the proper functioning of semiconductor devices. Therefore, controlling EPE is one of the most serious challenges in the field of multi-patterning and EUV lithography. EPE is a complex metric, involving error components from various process steps (e. g., lithography and etching steps). It is the combination of critical dimension (CD) errors and overlay errors (see Fig. 1(a)). The ratio of each component to the EPE budget changes with the iteration of the logic node (see Fig. 1(b)). Stochastic contributions to the EPE budget are increasing rapidly (>50%). Hence, the accurate estimation and measurement of each component of EPE, particularly the stochastic components, are critical to enabling a holistic approach to EPE control and thereby improving the yield. A holistic approach is adopted to optimize the EPE budget (see Fig. 2). This review is organized in five parts. First, we take a broad view of EPE in EUV lithography. Second, we highlight the characteristics peculiar to EUV lithography, considering the optical proximity correction (OPC) and stochastics. Third, we discuss two EPE models, including the optimization flow and the calculation process of EPE from metrology inputs (e. g., CD and overlay). Fourth, we present the metrologies of CD and overlay errors, summarizing the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Finally, we discuss the techniques for EPE. Progress The typical deep ultraviolet (DUV) immersion lithography works with a transmissive mask, while EUV works with a reflective one (see Fig. 4). In addition, the EUV mask is exposed under oblique incidence. Some characteristics such as flare, mask absorber behavior, and mask three-dimensional effects (M3D effects) need to be considered. For instance, M3D effects cause wafer-level deviations from the intended design of an integrated circuit. To address these issues, OPC can be used. The EUV OPC model error contribution of each physical effect is presented in Fig. 5(a). Typically, rule-based and model-based approaches are used. Sub-resolution assist features (SRAF) can be used to improve the depth of focus and exposure latitude at a given pitch. In addition, exploring machine learning OPC is also an important tendency. For EUV lithography, due to off-axis illumination and the large ratio between absorber thickness (50‒100 nm) and operating wavelength (13.5 nm), the mask needs rigorous electromagnetic field (EMF) solvers to simulate the light diffraction from the mask. The finite difference time domain (FDTD) method can be used to simulate the 3D masks, but it is computationally expensive and time-consuming. An approximate M3D filter calculation method based on an M3D library and a mask defocus is applied to predict the patterns on wafers. The energy of EUV (13.5 nm, ~92 eV) is larger than the resist atomic species' electron binding energies, and ionization is the main mechanism. In resist, the electrons can travel farther than 10 nm, which has implications for the understanding of noise, critical dimension uniformity (CDU), and line edge roughness (LER) variations. The stochastic nature of EUV lithography brings many undesirable effects, and it becomes worse when trying to manufacture at high resolution and high throughput. For EUV lithography, local critical dimension uniformity (LCDU) and LER are typically large because of the increased presence of stochastic noise in low doses. Three main approaches to controlling stochastics exist (see Fig. 6(a)). The stochastics can be simulated by Monte Carlo models or multivariate Poisson propagation models (MPPM). For the most advanced nodes, stochastics are generally considered to be the dominant aspect of an EPE budget. It is necessary to explore new methods to properly account for the stochastics in EPE budgets. Mulkens et al. provide a method that is widely applied. It is a computational method that links different EPE budget components. The definition of EPE is shown in Fig. 7(a). The calculation process of EPE from various CD and overlay metrology inputs is illustrated in Fig. 7(b). The EPE optimization flow (a five-step iterative process) is presented in Fig. 7(c). Mack et al. propose a more rigorous, stochastics-aware disposition approach for complementary lithography. By using measurable quantities, this model realizes the accurate prediction of EPE-based failure rates for lot dispositioning. The above two models are reviewed. With the CD shrinkage, the complex 3D architectures also increase. Worse still, for high NA EUV lithography, due to the reduction in the depth of focus, we apply thinner resist films (<15 nm). It brings a great challenge to conventional CD metrology (e. g., optical CD and CD-SEM). The mechanism, key limits, and challenges of CD metrology are summarized. Computational imaging is a promising technique because of the merits of higher resolution and a larger optical field of view. Tight and effective overlay control is essential to securing yield. The main contributors to the overlay budget are the scanner, mask, process, and overlay metrology. The overlay optimization flow is illustrated in Fig. 10(b). Optical overlay metrology has been widely adopted for overlay control. Imaging-based overlay (IBO) and diffraction-based overlay (DBO) are the two dominant technologies. The schematic overlay metrology method of DBO is shown in Fig. 11(a)‒(e). When the logic design rules are down to 3 nm, on-product overlay (OPO) is becoming the most important factor limiting yields. Overlay error metrology and systems with higher accuracy (sub-nm scale) are in demand. The accuracy limitations of optical overlay metrology promote complementary overlay metrology (e. g., electron beam-based overlay metrology). Conclusions and Prospects Reducing EPE is essential to enabling high yields in manufacturing processes. In this paper, OPC and stochastics in EUV lithography are highlighted. Two models of EPE are reviewed, and the principal components of an EPE budget are systematically discussed. A holistic approach is significant to meet the severe demands of patterning in EPE control. It combines computational mask optimization (e. g., OPC), wafer metrology overlay/CD, co-optimization with other processes (e. g., etch), the high-order actuation capability of DUV, and an EUV scanner. New characterization techniques are critical to providing more accurate descriptions of errors in EUV lithography. Computational imaging is a promising approach by which to increase the resolution of the inspection of masks/chips. Machine learning shows economic potential in EPE analysis. This topic is of significance to the roadmap toward technology nodes of 3 nm and below in the semiconductor industry. © 2024 Science Press. All rights reserved.},

Therefore, the 3D profile of the wafer can be reconstructed directly. Testing results show that both accuracy and precision of the Fabry–Pérot interferometer are within a nanometer scale. Defects, especially those embedded inside the wafer, will be detected by monitoring the leaky field with treating wafers as slab waveguides. With the leaky field detection, defects on the lower surface of the wafer were successfully detected by monitoring the leaky field above the upper surface of the wafer. Compared with traditional methods such as radiographic testing or computed tomography testing, the proposed methods provide a cost-effective alternative for wafer quality evaluation.

	abstract = {Honeycomb core sandwich structures (HCSSs) are used prevalently in the aerospace and marine industries. Use of guided wave-based inspections has attracted much attention in the recent past for facilitating the NDE of such structures. This paper presents the numerical and experimental analyses of the guided wave propagation through a tapered HCSS, with a primary motive to comprehend and further utilize the alteration of local wave properties as a function of the varying thickness. To this end, a low frequency fundamental antisymmetric mode is used as an interrogation signal. The numerical analysis is performed using 3D finite element simulations, while the experiments are performed on the portion of a helicopter blade with GFRP face sheets and aluminium core. The generation of the global guided waves (GGWs) as well as continuous variation of the local wave properties (wavenumber, group velocity, and phase speed) are ascertained both numerically as well as experimentally. Least-square polynomial fits are presented for the variation of group velocity along the propagation direction. A method of predicting the time of flight utilizing a non-uniform group velocity is outlined. Using this method and the polynomial fits, predictions of time-of-flight of the fundamental antisymmetric mode are made and corroborated with the observed values. Further, to circumvent the need of the prior knowledge of the group velocity variation in predicting the time-of-flight, a generalized expression of the variation of the group velocity is developed by employing the adiabatic nature of the GGW. The present analysis and the proposed methods can find their potential use in the wave-based NDE of tapered HCSS. © 2023},

	abstract = {Objective: Traditional quantitative analysis of bone microstructure in micro-computed tomography (microCT) is dependent on animal scale and requires parametric tuning in new implementations. This study aims to develop an automated and resolution-invariant 3D image processing workflow for quantitative assessment of osteophytes. Methods: In this workflow, cortical bone was segmented from microCT scans, and a 3D sphere-fitting transform was performed to obtain a thickness map, for which each voxel is assigned a thickness value corresponding to the size of the largest sphere containing the voxel that fits entirely within the cortical bone. From the thickness map, a 1-voxel thick outer surface was extracted to model surface roughness. The thickness values of the outer surface were empirically estimated by a series of known statistical distributions. Resulting parameters describing best-fit distributions, along with other cortical bone metrics, were analysed to determine sensitivity to osteoarthritis and the presence of osteophytes. Results: The workflow was validated using microCT scans and histological gradings of rabbit and rat tibiofemoral joints. Visual inspection shows that samples with osteoarthritis and the presence of osteophytes have more surface voxels assigned small thickness values. The distribution of surface thickness values for each animal is best described by Gamma distributions, whose shape parameter is consistently sensitive to osteoarthritis and the presence of osteophytes. Conclusion: Combining traditional image processing with empirical distribution fitting provides an automated, objective, and resolution-invariant workflow for osteophyte assessment. Significance: The proposed method is simple, yet elegant in its implementation, and can be readily used in new implementations. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {White Light Interferometry（WLI）is a classic low-coherence interferometry. The surface height information can be obtained with ultra-high precision through the positioning of zero optical path difference position of white light interference. At the same time， compared with point-sectioning laser confocal microscope，WLI is a surface-sectioning tomography technology. In particular，its vertical resolution is comparable to that of an atomic force microscope. White light interferometry measurement technology has been widely used in the inspection of semiconductor wafer defects，Micro-electromechanical System （MEMS）sensing structures，ultra-precision optical components，and film thicknesses. Generally，this technology originated in the late 1980 s in the United States，and domestic researches in this field started late，with the overall technology lagging behind. In terms of the instrumentation，although there have been breakthroughs，core components still rely on imports，such as interference objectives，nano-positioning scanners. A large field-of-view white light interferometric measurement system was built and tested. In this system，a domestic white light interference objective with a lateral magnification of 2 was used and a 0.5× adapter lens was preferably configured in the imaging system in front of the image detector. For the white LED illumination source，a suitable bandpass filter was theoretically evaluated and experimentally confirmed. The center wavelength was determined through the experimental curve of white light interference along the axial direction. The actual magnification of WLI system and the distortion of the field of view were achieved through imaging of a two-dimensional microscopic grid sample. The actual maximum field-of-view at the object side has reached 14 mm. By selectively filtering the spectrum of the white light source，the white light interference signal can be effectively modulated. According to this，the axial resolution and horizontal resolution can be changed within a certain range. For example，by changing the center wavelength of the incident light，the horizontal resolution can be changed according to the Rayleigh criterion. Experimental results show that：a more ideal white light interference axial response curve is obtained through suitable spectral filtering；the maximum field-of-view at the object side is as large as 14 mm；the measurement results of standard step samples with heights of 2.04 μm and 20.43 μm are 2.05 μm and 20.47 μm，and the repeatability（standard deviation）of 10 measurements is 12 nm and 16 nm，respectively. The measurement result of the 2.04 μm height step was also compared with the result obtained by the atomic force microscope. Actual measurements were conducted on the roughness sample，MEMS sensing structure and semiconductor wafer film，demonstrating the feasibility of the developed system in the field of three-dimensional optical non-destructive precision inspection. For large field-of-view WLI systems，the horizontal or lateral resolution is on the order of a few micrometers，so it is difficult to apply WLI to the three-dimensional reconstruction of fine microstructures. This is an important shortcoming of large field-of-view WLI systems. Besides，through research，it was found that for ultra-smooth surfaces，such as polished wafers，it is difficult to measure using traditional vertical scanning interferometry technology，and the phase shifting method should be used. Measurement of film thickness may be used to monitor morphological changes in biological transparent film layers. Further research can focus on high-performance white-light interference objectives，automation of the white-light interferometry measurement process，and implementation of large field-of-view high-resolution white-light interferometry methods. © 2024 Chinese Optical Society.

GPR was used to assess wall thickness and detect potential hidden voids within the building, providing detailed information on material integrity and identifying structural anomalies. Thermography was applied to locate beams and areas affected by humidity, offering essential data for corrective interventions and structural strengthening. The combination of TLS and visual inspection enabled the creation of an accurate 3D BIM model.

	abstract = {In the field of cultural heritage, replication has been performed for preservation, exhibition, and education purposes. In particular, due to advancement in computer technology, replication which combines the three-dimensional (3D) scanning and printing has widely performed. These technologies have been able to ensure morphological similarity as well as to avoid damaging artifacts in a contactless manner. In this study, a design mock-up for producing replacements was made for the purpose of preserving original forms, usability, and mass production for ritual utensils used in ancestral memorial rites annually. 3D precision scanner was used to obtain external information of ritual utensils and shape information of pattern parts. The measurements on height, width, and thickness of the body, and two handles and three feet showed fine shape differences, respectively. Therefore, representative models were selected and reconstructed. In addition, the upper and lower parts of the body, handles, and feet were separately manufactured for mass production by using sand casting. A model manufactured during the reverse design like above was completed by considering average shrinkage (4%) for the casting of copper-Tin alloys. A model was completed and 3D-printed with a material extrusion technique, and a design mock-up for replication was created. In this study, a 3D printing technology was applied to ritual utensils and presented a replication methodology applicable to used artifacts. For this purpose, a model suitable for the replication method was produced based on the data obtained by 3D scanning of ritual utensils. A design mock-up, which is 3D-printed with a material extrusion technique, has enhanced design completeness by performing continuous design and dimensional inspection. © 2021 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.

	abstract = {Background: Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a neuronal migration disorder and is a major cause of drug-resistant epilepsy. However, many focal abnormalities remain undetected during routine visual inspection, and many patients with histologically confirmed FCD have normal fluid-Attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR-negative) images. The aim of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the changes in cortical thickness with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of patients to identify FCD lesions from FLAIR-negative images. Methods: We first used the three-dimensional (3D) Laplace method to calculate the cortical thickness for individuals and obtained the cortical thickness mean image and cortical thickness standard deviation (SD) image based on all 32 healthy controls. Then, a cortical thickness extension map was computed by subtracting the cortical thickness mean image from the cortical thickness image of each patient and dividing the result by the cortical thickness SD image. Finally, clusters of voxels larger than three were defined as the FCD lesion area from the cortical thickness extension map. Results: The results showed that three of the four lesions that occurred in non-Temporal areas were detected in three patients, but the detection failed in three patients with lesions that occurred in the temporal area. The quantitative analysis of the detected lesions in voxel-wise on images revealed the following: specificity (99.78%), accuracy (99.76%), recall (67.45%), precision (20.42%), Dice coefficient (30.01%), Youden index (67.23%) and area under the curve (AUC) (83.62%). Conclusion: Our studies demonstrate an effective method to localize lesions in non-Temporal lobe regions. This novel method automatically detected FCD lesions using only FLAIR-negative images from patients and was based only on cortical thickness feature. The method is noninvasive and more effective than a visual analysis for helping doctors make a diagnosis. © 2020 The Author(s).},

This method uses a scanning procedure of synchronously moving the laser ultrasound generator and the ultrasound detector on the opposite side of the sample. The cross-correlation algorithm is used to calculate the time delay of the transmitted transverse wave at each scanning point. Finally, the location of the internal defect can be estimated by considering the thickness of the sample and the distance between the two maximum signal delay points in the left scanning and the right scanning.

During the high-speed inspection, a relative motion occurred between the pipeline inspection gauge (PIG) and the steel pipe wall will generate motion-induced eddy current (MIEC). There is a lack of research on analyzing the effect of MIEC on high-speed MFL inspection for thick-wall steel pipe. In this article, a three-dimensional (3D) finite-element method (FEM) simulations are conducted with an inspection speed range of 0 m/s to 8 m/s and a wall thickness range of 8 mm to 15 mm. Simulation results show that both high-speed inspection and thick-wall thickness will decrease the magnetization of steel pipe. It is observed that, at the speed of 8 m/s and the thickness of 15 mm, the magnetic field strength is lower than 2 kA/m and the steel pipe exits from the magnetic saturation zone, which causes the severe distortion of three-axis MFL signals, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is lower than 6 dB. A high-speed PIG is developed here for experiments to measure the three-axis MFL signals. The characteristics of simulated and measured MFL signals are found to be quite consistent. © 2019, © 2019 American Society for Nondestructive Testing.},

The study shows that this methodology has significant merits on accurately assessing such bridge deck components when bridge design records are non-existing, and by using non-invasive methods such as laser scanning and GPR. The great advantage provided by the TLS technique is the possibility to obtain a 3D output model of the scanned element with the accuracy of the best topographic instruments in order to complement GPR data surveys for bridge inspection. © 2020.

	abstract = {Thin-walled structures are widely used in aerospace, offshore, civil, marine and other engineering industries. Buckling of such thin-walled imperfection sensitive structures is a very important phenomenon to be considered during their design phase. Existing design guidelines, being the most known the NASA SP-8007 for cylinders dated from the late 1960's are currently used in the aerospace industry and employ conservative lower-bound knock-down factors. These empirically based lower-bound methods do not include important mechanical properties of laminated composite materials, such as the stacking sequence. New design approaches that allow taking full advantage of composite materials are therefore required. This study deals with buckling experiments of axially compressed, unstiffened carbon fiber–reinforced polymer (CFRP) cylinders with and without an additional lateral load. Two geometrically identical cylinders with the same layup were designed, manufactured and tested. Before testing, the thickness of the cylinders was measured with ultrasonic inspection and the geometry was measured utilizing a 3D scanning system based on photogrammetry. During testing, a digital image correlation system was employed to monitor deformations, strain gage readings and load-shortening data was taken. Modelling of shape mid-surface and thickness imperfections as well as fiber volume fraction correction are included into the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of the test structures, and the experimental results are compared against FEA results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Coal is the most economical and reliable energy that can achieve clean and efficient use. The intelligent, safe, efficient development of coal resources and low-carbon clean utilization are the core technical support for achieving high-quality development of China' s coal industry. Based on the development requirements of the primary stage of coal mine intelligentization in China, the research and engineering construction of the coal mine intelligent technology system was carried out. The top-level design and research of intelligent coal mines were carried out, and the overall architecture of intelligent coal mines was divided into several layers including equipment layer, infrastructure layer, service layer and application layer based on the concept of "mine working as the platform", and a special high-speed transmission network was built in the mining area, and data format and communication agreements and standards were unified. A number of platforms and systems have been built, including big data cloud platform, coal mine intelligent center and integrated management system, coal mine safety strong real-time communication network and underground precise location service system, geological support and 4D-GIS dynamic information system, roadway intelligent rapid tunneling system, mining work surface intelligent cooperative control system, coal flow and auxiliary transportation and warehousing intelligent system, coal mine underground environment awareness and safety management and control system, coal cleaning and intelligent system, coal mine full station equipment and health intelligent management system, coal mine area and green ecological intelligence system, etc., to achieve intelligent closed-loop management of coal mine production, safety, ecology, and security. For the information island problem in intelligent coal mines, technical research on multi-source heterogeneous data modeling, feature extraction, and data mining was carried out. The data-driven information entity modeling and update technology used a bottom-up approach to extract the attributes, associated information and functional information of the monitoring data, and constructed the mapping relationship between different data information, and established a mining information sharing service platform, provided data services in different application scenarios underground. In view of the problem that the existing coal shearer' s memory cutting was difficult to adapt to the coal seam thickness and changes in various geological conditions, an intelligent coal mine high- precision three-dimensional geological model construction method was studied, and a coal seam thickness adaptive cutting control method based on the dynamic update of the geological model was proposed. A three-dimensional geological model of coal seam thickness was established through the coal seam geological information,which used the coal-rock interface information obtained during the shearing process of the coal shearer to modify the geological model in real time, and planned ahead the cutting path of the next coal cut in order to realize automatic cutting control of the shearer based on the self-adaptation of coal seam thickness. The intelligent design technology was developed for working face mining and connection. By constructing a GIS "one map" distributed collaborative integration platform based on a unified spatial database, the geological information, engineering information, and equipment information were unified into a " one map". The position coordinates of the continuous working face were entered in the geological model, the system automatically calculated the working face length, mining height, reserves and other related information, and based on the calculation results, it automatically selected the supporting design of the working face equipment and completed the various drawings and reports of the working face. The intelligent design of drawings, rules and specifications of the continuous working face were compiled and realized, which greatly reduced the repeated labor in the process of mining and excavation; the posture detection and navigation technology, automatic anchoring technology, automatic net laying technology, roadway 3D modeling and quality monitoring technology were studied, using laser target and inclination sensor combined navigation technology for directional navigation and self-correction of the roadheader; automatic mesh laying device was used with anchor drill rig to achieve roadway surrounding rock automatic bolt support; a laser scanning system was used to quickly scan and measure the roadway through the image stitching matching algorithm, to build a three-dimensional accurate model of the roadway, and achieve accurate monitoring of the quality of the roadway formation; through intelligent driving equipment and geology, the fusion of multi-source information such as spatial information was used to realize holographic perception and scene reproduction of the driving face; ultrasonic and laser combined ranging sensors were used to achieve a wide and accurate measurement of the relative position between the various equipment on the driving face, and the characteristics of ultrasonic measurement was used to determine the spatial relative motion mode of the associated equipment; the characteristics of high laser ranging accuracy was used to determine the precise location of the associated equipment, personnel identification sensors were used to perceive the personnel in the non-working area, and compiled through the operation process regulations and parameters between the equipment. The interlocking and coordinated control program of the complete equipment realized the coordinated linkage of the complete equipment for the excavation. The intelligent mining face featuring " manned patrol, unmanned operation" has been gradually promoted and applied throughout the country. The development and practice of shearer adaptive cutting technology based on the dynamic update of the three-dimensional geological model has been carried out in the middle of the shearer. A high-precision 3D gyroscope was used to monitor the position and posture of the shearer in real time, and combined the monitoring results with the aforementioned high-precision 3D geological model to determine the coordinate position of the shearer in the 3D geological model; The inspection robot was installed on the scraper conveyor, and a three-dimensional laser scanner was installed on the inspection robot to effectively merge the three-dimensional laser scanning data with the unit geological model data, the shearer posture data, and the shearer rocker cutting data. The real-time cutting curve of the shearer can be obtained, by comparing the actual shearing curve of the shearer with the geological model of the coal-rock layer interface curve, to achieve intelligent adjustment of the shearing height of the shearer. The coal and rock interface information was input into the 3D geological model, and the coal and rock interface information of 3 to 5 m in front of the working face was dynamically updated based on the difference algorithm, and good test results were obtained in some mining areas. The intelligent ventilation system was studied, and the parameters such as air volume, wind speed, gas and temperature at key points of the mine were monitored, and the technology of multi-source data coupling analysis, redundancy analysis, three-dimensional modeling, etc.which was used to perform real-time dynamic calculation of the mine ventilation network. The calculated data in real time was correlated to control related equipment such as mine main ventilator, local ventilator, air door, air window and so on. The paper analyzed the technical difficulties and solutions of the application of intelligent cleaning technology, intelligent auxiliary transportation technology, and 5G communication technology in coal mines, and systematically analyzed the key technical problems that restrict the construction of intelligent coal mines from the perspective of technology research and development. The paper elaborated in detail on the current stage achievements of large domestic coal production enterprises,such as Shendong Coal Group, Yankuang Group,Datong Coal Mine Group, Yangmei Coal Group, Zibo Mining Group, Xinwen Mining Group, etc. in the construction stage of intelligent coal mines. The combination of research and development and field practice analyzed the main technical problems and development directions in the process of intelligent coal mine construction. A study was carried outon the coal mine intelligent standard system, the framework of the coal mine intelligent standard system was put forward, and the "intelligent coal mine classification, classification of technical conditions and evaluation index system", "intelligent comprehensive mining face classification, classification evaluation technical conditions and index system" and other related standards were drafted, providing standard support for the high-quality development of intelligent coal mine construction. © Meitan Kexun Jishu/Coal Science and Technology (Peking) 2020.},

	abstract = {We present here the development and evaluation of a deep learning (artificial intelligence)-based computer vision machine to automate segmentation of multiclass progressive matrix damage across micro and mesoscales in aerospace-grade advanced composite laminates visualized in 4D via nondestructive in situ mechanical testing coupled with synchrotron radiation computed tomography (SRCT). Leveraging tens of thousands of manually-/human-annotated SRCT tomograms (i.e., 2D virtual cross-sectional slices) encompassing two different aerospace-grade advanced composite laminate systems (standard-thickness-ply and thin-ply) that were SRCT-scanned while under progressive tensile loading, we teach a fully convolutional neural network machine to segment complex polymer matrix damage mechanisms according to their host ply, replacing ~10 hours of trained human labor per scan segmentation (~2000 tomograms per scan) with negligible time to configure the trained machine data-processing pipeline. Evaluating qualitatively and quantitatively the segmented tomograms independently in 2D, as well as collectively in 3D scans, we demonstrate good agreement between the state-of-the-art human-based region growing (semi-manual) method and machine-based segmentation results, summarized by test set macro-averages of the following common classification/segmentation performance metrics: 79% for F1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) and 67% for intersection over union (IoU) score. Moreover, 2D inspection of segmented damage within tomograms reveals that F1 and IoU scores actually underrate machine performance due to a nontrivial degree of human (used as ground truth) segmentation error, as the machine is found to regularly exceed the human (resulting in F1 and IoU score penalties) by discovering new damage instances, augmenting existing diffuse segmentations, and extending segmentations to image artifact-prone specimen edges. Consequently, we discover that deep learning-based segmentation successfully and efficiently characterizes sparse (<<1% of scan volume), extremely complex 3D damage states within SRCT datasets, resolving an intractable computer vision challenge (as viewed through the lens of traditionally programmed automation) and establishing these high-throughput tools as promising candidates to accelerate understanding of basic structure-property relationships in traditional and next-generation advanced composite materials. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

	abstract = {This work focuses on the combination of two complementary non-destructive techniques to analyse the final deformation and internal damage induced in aramid composite plates subjected to ballistic impact. The first analysis device, a 3D scanner, allows digitalising the surface of the tested specimen. Comparing with the initial geometry, the permanent residual deformation (PBFD) can be obtained according to the impact characteristics. This is a significant parameter in armours and shielding design. The second inspection technique is based on computed tomography (CT). It allows analysing the internal state of the impacted sample, being able to detect possible delamination and fibre failure through the specimen thickness. The proposed methodology has been validated with two projectile geometries at different impact velocities, being the reaction force history on the specimen determined with piezoelectric sensors. Different loading states and induced damages were observed according to the projectile type and impact velocity. In order to validate the use of the 3D scanner, a correlation between impact velocity and damage induced in terms of permanent back face deformation has been realised for both projectiles studied. In addition, a comparison of the results obtained through this measurement method and those obtained in similar works, has been performed in the same range of impact energy. The results showed that CT is needed to analyse the internal damage of the aramid sample; however, this is a highly expensive and time-consuming method. The use of 3D scanner and piezoelectric sensors is perfectly complementary with CT and could be relevant to develop numerical models or design armours. © 2020 by the authors.

The causes of defect were analyzed according to the macroscopic shape and location of the folding, and the theoretical analysis was verified by Deform-3D finite element numerical simulation. According to the volume invariance principle in the metal plastic forming theory, the thickness of correlative preformed upper mold in the longitudinal and transverse directions of the toothed disc was optimized:the longitudinal thickness of the forging disc is reduced by a maximum of 2 mm, while the transverse thickness of the circular part is reduced by a maximum of 6 mm in positions with the largest size changes, ensuring that a 17 mm high mushroom head like structure can be added to eliminate the folding defect and guarantee the production of qualified forgings. For the improved mold structure, the rationality and reliability of the optimized mold structure were ensured by the second analysis of the forming process based on Deform-3D, and the qualified forging parts are ensured to be producted continuous and normally by pre-finish process under the premise of eliminating the defects.

Better monitoring of seabed installations will lower maintenance costs, provide greater control and reduce risk to installation integrity. For topside installations, there are several methods of inspection and monitoring available, but subsea, the challenge has been to find technology that works and provides real value. The growing number of aging subsea installations increases the need for good retrofit solutions. Research and development of guided-wave methods for asset monitoring and screening has been ongoing for several years and over this time ClampOn has developed a non-invasive instrument which can be used on new subsea installations or retrofitted by ROV to existing installations. While developing this guided wave based system, ClampOn's research team has worked in parallel to develop and implement more technology in the system which will provide high-resolution 3D data for the area being monitored. Tomography is already used elsewhere, such as in medical applications, but has never before been used as part of a fixed subsea system to monitor wall thickness loss in pipelines. Key learning outcome: ClampOn has developed a system that not only provides direct measurement of and important information about ongoing corrosion and erosion, but also offers highly accurate high-resolution 3D imaging of subsea pipes securing pipeline integrity. © 2018 SPE All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This work presents the analysis and corresponding characterization of two representative tunnelling constructions, showing different constructive conditions. Diverse data acquisition and processing approaches were considered depending on the type of the structure, geometric characteristics and surveying conditions. The first study case includes an underground reinforced concrete tunnel system with symmetric geometry, which is composed by a central corridor and lateral branches. For its documentation and characterization, three-dimensional imaging methodologies were applied to create a volumetric reconstruction of its whole underground network. Problems of moisture were also detected by the attenuation of the radar-wave signal, and finite-difference time-domain modelling was used as a supporting tool for data interpretation. After a deeper analysis of both field and synthetic data, and additional visual inspection, it was concluded that such portions of the structure, presenting this lack of information, are affected by corrosion in reinforcement. On the other hand, a GPR study was conducted through a bench excavation tunnel, in order to monitor quality control during the early stages of construction and to evaluate the tunnel stability. According to this benchmark, results provided noteworthy characteristics, namely: thickness of the shotcrete layer, lining damages and moisture problems. © 2015 IEEE.},

Besides conventional NDE&T lab methods such as eddy current test (ECT) for thickness measurement and fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI) for cracking detection, some latest NDE techniques have been developed, demonstrated and applied to evaluate and characterize thermal sprayed coatings recently. The improved and innovative NDE methods provide more capable and accurate measurement to inspect on surface morphology, 2D and 3D coating porosity, oxide content, interface debonding, as well as other types of coating features, defects or specific properties. In this work, some non-contact NDE techniques and their applications were investigated and discussed based on several case studies of thermal sprayed coatings. Laser confocal microscopy had been used for characterizing surface morphologies and roughness profiles of HVOF WC-based coatings with 2D and 3D mapping methods. In particular, thermal wave imaging and ultrasonic micro imaging methods were used to detect the suspicious existence of lateral coating separation within or at the MCrAlY coating-substrate interfaces. Laser dimension sensoring method exhibited the extended capability of in-situ coating thickening measurements on turbine blade and vane.

	abstract = {In the wake of today's industrial revolution, many advanced technologies and techniques have been developed to address the complex challenges in well integrity evaluation. One of the most prominent innovations is the integration of physics-based data science for robust downhole measurements. This paper introduces a promising breakthrough in electromagnetism-based corrosion imaging using physics informed machine learning (PIML), tested and validated on the cross-sections of real metal casings/tubing with defects of various sizes, locations, and spacing. Unlike existing electromagnetism-based inspection tools, where only circumferential average metal thickness is measured, this research investigates the artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted interpretation of a unique arrangement of electromagnetic (EM) sensors. This facilitates the development of a novel solution for through-tubing corrosion imaging that enhances defect detection with pixel-level accuracy. The developed framework incorporates a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)-based EM forward solver and an artificial neural network (ANN), namely the long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN). The ANN is trained using the results generated from the FDTD solver, which simulates sensor readings for different scenarios of defects. The integration of the array EM-sensor responses and an ANN enabled generalizable and accurate measurements of metal loss percentage across various experimental defects. It also enabled the precise predictions of the defects' aperture sizes, numbers, and locations in 360-degree coverage. Results were plotted in customized 2D heat-maps for any desired cross-section of the test casings. Further analysis of different techniques demonstrated that the LSTM-RNN could show higher precision and robustness compared to regular dense NNs, especially in the case of multiple defects. The LSTM-RNN is validated using additional data from simulated and experimental data. The results show reliable predictions even with limited training data. The model accurately predicted defects of larger and smaller sizes that were intentionally excluded from the training data to demonstrate generalizability. This highlights a major advance toward corrosion imaging behind tubing. This novel technique paves the way for the use of similar concepts on other sensors in multiple barriers imaging. Further work includes improvement to the sensor package and ANNs by adding a third dimension to the imaging capabilities to produce 3D images of defects on casings. © 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers},

The efficient suppression of combined sodium and SP signal is acquired through the use of WMF to enhance the signal/noise ratio (between 6 and 9) for detection of partial (up to 30% depth from tube wall thickness) or full circumferential (20% depth) outer tube defects. © 2019 IOS Press and the authors.

	abstract = {In the context of subterrain well inspection, it is important to efficiently and accurately evaluate the quality of the cement sheath that fills the annular region between the rock formation and the casing, which is a string of steel tubes. A continuously increasing number of such wells are being drilled in extreme environments requiring heavy, attenuative fluid filling the borehole for well stabilization, and larger and thicker casings for mechanical stability. Under those conditions, examining and ensuring the quality of the cement for safety reasons is of paramount importance. We have studied the limits of the most common ultrasonic pulse-echo-based technique for cement evaluation and corrosion detection. Its principle is based on the analysis of the resonance frequency and decay rate of an ultrasonic pulse reverberating in the casing. By analyzing the echo it extracts information about casing geometry and the acoustic impedance of the outer medium. Due to the specific geometrical requirements of the technique, the inhomogeneous, attenunative fluids and the thicker-walled casings pose increased demands on the processing approach. To overcome this problem we have developed a robust, calibration-free inversion algorithm based on a full 3D-model of the ultrasonic pulse-echo transducer which honors the physics of all interactions and the actual geometry. Unlike other methods, the here presented technique does not require the a priori knowledge of environmental parameters such as fluid properties, which are instead deduced from the measurement itself. The exponential decay of the received echo envelope depends on two parameters: the acoustic impedance of the fluid and that of the annulus both of which we find simultaneously by fitting the slope and the offset of the tail. In addition, the algorithm's optimization of performance time by several orders in magnitude allows usage of this processing in real time on a standard computer. Extensive laboratory studies and field testing have been carried out to support and validate the algorithm over an extended range of logging conditions, fluid types and a comprehensive set of casings with diameters up to 22 in. and wall thicknesses up to 1.25 in. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Underwater structure inspections are essential for infrastructure maintenance, such as hydraulic facilities, bridges, and ports. Due to the influence of turbidity, dark light, and distortion, the traditional methods cannot satisfy the requirements of on-site inspection applications. This paper proposed a methodology of the point cloud data capture in the turbid underwater environment. The method consisted of an acquisition device, a distortion correction algorithm, and a parameter optimization approach. The acquisition device was designed by composing a silt-removing module, a structured light camera module, and a clear water replacement module, which can integrate with an underwater inspection robot. The underwater multi-medium plane refraction distortion model was established through analysis, and a refraction correction algorithm was provided to correct the distortion. To obtain the maximum field of view of the point cloud, the nonlinear optimization approach was used to select the medium material and thickness. After the real experiments using the Intel RealSense sr300 depth camera, maximum measuring distance could range up to 253 mm in water, the accuracy of the point cloud of the underwater target objects was ±3.77 mm, and the maximum error was 8.76%. Compared with other methods, this method was more suitable for 3D point cloud capture in the turbidity environment.  © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The efficiency of eight algorithms of defect depth characterization (pulse phase thermography – PPT, thermographic signal reconstruction by analyzing the first and second derivatives– TSR, early observation – EO, apparent thermal inertia – ATI, thermal quadrupoles - TQ, non-linear fitting - NLF and neural networks – NN) has been comparatively analyzed on both theoretical and experimental IR image sequences obtained in the inspection of CFRP composite. Synthetic noise-free image sequences have been calculated by means of the ThermoCalc-3D software, while experimental results have been obtained by applying a one-sided procedure of pulsed thermal NDT to the inspection of artificial defects in CFRP. A relative error in the evaluation of defect depth has been chosen as a figure of merit. It has been demonstrated that a simple and robust processing technique is the use of the Fourier transform resulting in phase-domain data (PPT). The technique of TSR ensures maximal values of signal-to-noise ratio and is less susceptible to uneven heating and lateral heat diffusion. The calculation of ATI has allowed the characterization of defects at depths up to 1.5 mm, but it is sensitive to uneven heating thus requiring to carefully choose a non-defect area. The EO method, as well as the technique of TQ, have revealed inferior results in defect depth identification because of a noisy character of raw signals. Non-linear fitting is a convenient processing technique allowing simultaneous characterization of some test parameters, such as material thermal properties, defect depth and thickness, etc., but this technique is time-consuming and can hardly be applied to full-format images. In the whole defect depth range, minimal characterization errors have been ensured by the use of the NN that is a promising tool for automated identification of hidden defects. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The impact-echo (IE) acoustic inspection method is a non-destructive evaluation technique, which has been widely applied to detect the defects, structural deterioration level, and thickness of plate-like concrete structures. This paper presents a novel climbing robot, namely Rise-Rover, to perform automated IE signal collection from concrete structures with IE signal analyzing based on machine learning techniques. Rise-Rover is our new generation robot, and it has a novel and enhanced absorption system to support heavy load, and crawler-like suction cups to maintain high mobility performance while crossing small grooves. Moreover, the design enables a seamless transition between ground and wall. This paper applies the fast Fourier transform and wavelet transform for feature detection from collected IE signals. A distance metric learning based support vector machine approach is newly proposed to automatically classify the IE signals. With the visual-inertial odometry of the robot, the detected flaws of inspection area on the concrete plates are visualized in 2D/3D.

The present paper reports initial results from tests where these techniques were applied to a pipeline specimen containing a plain longitudinal dented subjected to hydrostatic cyclic loading. Some of the material’s fatigue properties assessment used validated rapid approaches based on infrared thermography. The monitoring of fatigue initiation and propagation in the actual specimen used nondestructive infrared inspection techniques. Thermoelasticity stress analysis (TSA) and three-dimensional digital image correlation (3D-DIC) were used to determine fatigue hot spots locations as well as strain concentrations. Full field TSA and fiber optic Bragg strain gages (FBSG) were used to determine the overall stress field (TSA) as well hot spot strain evolution (FBSG) along the loading cycles. Strain fields determined from the experimental measurements and from finite element analysis (FEA) were combined with the fatigue Coffin-Manson model to predict fatigue life (Nc). The tested 3 m long tubular specimen was fabricated with API 5L Gr. B 12.75″ OD with ¼″ thickness pipes. The excellent agreement among test and predicted results achieved up to now are commented in the paper. © Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2020.},

	abstract = {Due to the well-known problem of 3He shortage, a series of different thermal neutron detectors alternative to helium tubes are being developed, with the goal to find valid candidates for detection systems for the future spallation neutron sources such as the European Spallation Source (ESS). A possible 3He-free detector candidate is a charged particle detector equipped with a three dimensional neutron converter cathode (3D-C). The 3D-C currently under development is composed by a series of alumina (Al2O3) lamellas coated by 1 μm of 10B enriched boron carbide (B4C). In order to obtain a good characterization in terms of detector efficiency and uniformity it is crucial to know the thickness, the uniformity and the atomic composition of the B4C neutron converter coating. In this work a non-destructive technique for the characterization of the lamellas that will compose the 3D-C was performed using neutron radiography. The results of these measurements show that the lamellas that will be used have coating uniformity suitable for detector applications. This technique (compared with SEM, EDX, ERDA, XPS) has the advantage of being global (i.e. non point-like) and non-destructive, thus it is suitable as a check method for mass production of the 3D-C elements. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab srl.},

	abstract = {Nowadays complex ceramic components are produced with high precision by Stereolithography. This method shows limitations when producing ceramic components having a wall thickness greater than approx. 10 ​mm. This is due to the amount of organic binder in the green bodies that, evacuating from the inner microstructure during the thermal debinding, brings to the formation of defects such as cracks and delaminations. To overcome this issue, the so-called “design for AM” approach can be exploited. In this work we replaced the inner body with a less voluminous porous architecture having a larger surface through which the decomposed binder can evacuate. Tubes filled with periodic architectures were 3D-printed using an Alumina-based photosensitive slurry. Several topology combinations were tested, by varying both the cell type and the struts diameter. The quality of the produced samples was analyzed through morphological inspections, while the mechanical properties (i.e. stresses and deformations) were assessed via FEM simulations. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Corrosion as common damage in civil, petrochemical, nuclear, and aerospace structures affects the integrity and safety of the structures and may lead to catastrophic failures. This paper presents dispersion curve regression-assisted local wavenumber analysis method, which can analyze the time–space wavefield containing wideband information of wave-damage interaction and further extract the structural information carried by such wavefield for characterizing hidden corrosion damage in an isotropic plate. To acquire the time–space wavefield, a noncontact scanning laser Doppler vibrometer is used. In our analysis method, the acquired time–space wavefield is firstly processed to generate a local wavenumber function. The derived wavenumber function is further analyzed with a dispersion curve regression step, which searches in a set of theoretical frequency-wavenumber dispersion curves for different plate thicknesses and identifies the optimal plate thickness whose theoretical curve best matches the frequency-wavenumber relation contained in the local wavenumber function. By this means, a 3D profile including both in plane and thickness dimensions of the structure can be constructed for corrosion visualization and quantification. The experimental study demonstrates that our method can quantify the profile of hidden uniform corrosion in metal plates in terms of its in-plane shape and size as well as its out-of-plane depth in the subwavelength scale. Moreover, compared to previous Lamb wave-based corrosion inspection methods, our technique allows for noncontact 3D characterization of hidden corrosion from a far distance to the structure. We believe this work will inspire new 3D damage quantification methods that are based on wavefield analysis as well as enable potential applications for the quantification of hidden corrosion in civil, petrochemical, nuclear, and aerospace structures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: There is a potential for direct model manufacturing of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) using 3D printing technique for generating flexible semi-transparent prototypes. A patient-specific AAA model was manufactured using fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printing technology. A flexible, semi-transparent thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), called Cheetah Water (produced by Ninjatek, USA), was used as the flexible, transparent material for model manufacture with a hydrophilic support structure 3D printed with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Printing parameters were investigated to evaluate their effect on 3D–printing precision and transparency of the final model. ISO standard tear resistance tests were carried out on Ninjatek Cheetah specimens for a comparison of tear strength with silicone rubbers. Results: It was found that an increase in printing speed decreased printing accuracy, whilst using an infill percentage of 100% and printing nozzle temperature of 255 °C produced the most transparent results. The model had fair transparency, allowing external inspection of model inserts such as stent grafts, and good flexibility with an overall discrepancy between CAD and physical model average wall thicknesses of 0.05 mm (2.5% thicker than the CAD model). The tear resistance test found Ninjatek Cheetah TPU to have an average tear resistance of 83 kN/m, higher than any of the silicone rubbers used in previous AAA model manufacture. The model had lower cost (4.50 GBP per model), shorter manufacturing time (25 h 3 min) and an acceptable level of accuracy (2.61% error) compared to other methods. Conclusions: It was concluded that the model would be of use in endovascular aneurysm repair planning and education, particularly for practicing placement of hooked or barbed stents, due to the model’s balance of flexibility, transparency, robustness and cost-effectiveness. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Thin-walled conical structures are widely used in aerospace, offshore, civil and other engineering fields. Parts of space launcher transport systems are one example for the application of conical shells. Buckling of such thin-walled imperfection sensitive structures is a very important phenomenon to be considered during their design phase. Nowadays, the analysts still use empirically based lower-bound methods such as the NASA SP-8007 for cylinders and SP-8019 for cones to calculate the required knock-down factors (KDFs), which do not include important mechanical properties of laminated composite materials, such as the stacking sequence. New design approaches that allow taking full advantage of composite materials are therefore required.The study deals with the buckling experiments on axially compressed, unstiffened carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) truncated cones performed by DLR for validation of high-fidelity numerical models. Three geometrically identical cones with different layup were designed, manufactured and tested. Before testing, the thickness of the cones was measured with ultrasonic inspection and the geometry was measured utilizing a 3D scanning system based on photogrammetry. During testing, a digital image correlation system was employed to monitor deformations, strain gage readings and load-shortening data were taken.

	abstract = {Results of investigations of diffraction phenomena on constant-thickness three-dimensional objects with flat inner surfaces (thick plates) are summarized on the basis of our constructive theory of their calculation as applied to dimensional inspection. It is based on diffraction models of 3D objects with the use of equivalent diaphragms (distributions), which allow the Kirchhoff–Fresnel approximation to be effectively used. In contrast to available rigorous and approximate methods, the present approach does not require cumbersome calculations; it is a clearly arranged method, which ensures sufficient accuracy for engineering applications. It is found that the fundamental diffraction parameter for 3D objects of constant thickness d is the critical diffraction angle θcr=λ/d at which the effect of three-dimensionality on the spectrum of the 3D object becomes appreciable. Calculated Fraunhofer diffraction patterns (spectra) and images of constant-thickness 3D objects with absolutely absorbing, absolutely reflecting, and gray internal faces are presented. It is demonstrated that selection of 3D object fragments can be performed by choosing an appropriate configuration of the wave illuminating the object (plane normal or inclined waves, spherical waves). © 2017, Allerton Press, Inc.},

	abstract = {With the development of CMOS Si node shrinking from 65 nm to 32 nm, 28 nm to 14nm, the number of I/O of chips increases dramatically and the space of interconnection bumps becomes smaller and smaller. Fine pitch copper bump technology is more and more widely used in advanced flip chip package. When the pitch between bumps is less than 40um, the conventional mass reflow soldering can no longer meet the accuracy requirement of flip chip mounting. In addition, the warpage of ultra-thin die changes obviously during the reflow process in the process of 3D chip stacking. Thermal Compression Bonding (TCB) process can overcome the above two problems very well. TCB technology fixes the chip in the mounting position by bonding head, and heats the chip in place quickly, so that the bump joint can be formed rapidly, which overcomes the problems of chip misplacement & warpage in the mass reflow process. At present, TCB technology has been widely used in 3D chip stacking. At present, the mainstream HBM packaging adopts via middle TSV process. In the chip assembly, the front side of the DRAM wafer is attached with NCF film through the vacuum film laminator, and then the wafer is sent to dicing. Subsequently, the Thermal Compression Bonding (TCB) process is used to sequentially realize the flip-chip assembly between the multilayer DRAM chips and the logic chip. The main processes involved in HBM assembly also include wafer level molding, molding layer backside grinding, RDL and bumping processes on the backside of logic chip after wafer molding, etc. Based on the technical requirement of 3D multi-layer chip stacking, we design the test vehicle with four layers of 60um thickness chip, in which the top die is a single side bumping chip. In addition to the top layer chip, three layers of bottom chips adopt double-side bumping structure with 10um diameter TSV vertical interconnection. In the chip area of 5x5mm, there are 1158 micro-bumps. The minimum pitch between bumps is 40um and the clearance height after stacking is less than 20um. In this study, Non Conductive Film (NCF) is used in TCB process. NCF is a substitute material for traditional liquid Non Conductive Paste (NCP). The same as NCP, NCF is also a kind of thermosetting material. It warps the bump at high temperature and becomes solid when it cools down to room temperature. At the end of the process, NCF fills the gap and protects the bump. There are several technical difficulties in TCB-NCF process development, including NCF film vacuum lamination, multi-layer chip stacking, TCB bonding parameter adjustment and etc. In this study, 100% bump joint interconnection in die stacking is achieved by optimizing TCB parameters. Meanwhile, NCF can fully fill the gap between chips and pass C-SAM inspection. NCF thickness is optimized to ensure the minimum bleeding out. After the bottom chip is bonded to the silicon bare die by TCB-NCF method, the fully oven cure of NCF material is arranged, and then the stacking of the subsequent three chips is completed with the same process flow. TCB-NCF assembly process for C2W (Chip to Wafer) stacking is developed successfully. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Electrode manufacturing is one of the most critical processes within the energy storage production chain, as the electrodes coating and drying quality determines the later performance of the energy storage system in large part. Critical quality losses within the electrode coating are often optical visible, but cannot be automatically and inline inspected. Often small defects like agglomerates, capillary cracks or pinholes in the carbon or metal oxide based layers have to be detected at high web speeds. In the work described in this paper it was examined which kind of features and defects can be recognized by two optical methods: visual inspection and 3D measuring. A visual camera in conjunction with a white illumination and a 3D data laser line system has been used. Image processing algorithms are applied on the scanned data to detect pinholes and agglomerates. Also thickness of coating, gradient of the coating edge and form anomalies can be determined out of the produced data. Reliable evaluation of pinholes even of small sizes has been proofed. Particle agglomerations are more challenging. To achieve good enough data for 3D evaluation standard sensors are often insufficient, due to the necessary resolution and the production speed that requires high scanning frequency. In order to provide an automated, digitalized production and inspection system, the devices were coupled to a central experiment management system. Their operation is controlled non-locally in the cloud and synchronized with the execution of experiments. The acquired raw data is stored for later evaluation and long-term archiving. © SPIE.

An objective function for optimizing the process planning parameters is proposed in which perimetral offsets for each layer are considered as a parameter in addition to the layer thickness. The root-mean-square (RMS) value of the deviations between the NURBS representation of the CAD model and its built-up simulation is suggested to estimate a quantitative measure for the uncertainties. The proposed approach eliminates the sophistication of the calculation cusp volume in 3D space and has more compatibility with the corresponding inspection processes. The developed methodology is introduced based on using a metaheuristic algorithm to find the optimal layer thicknesses and perimetral offsets for a built-up model. A data collecting approach is also introduced to reduce the computation time associated with the simulation of the build-up model at each iteration. The developed methodology potentially can be used for layer-based additive manufacturing processes. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Slowly but surely, more and more automated thermography measurement is being applied in industry. Thermography provides a high sensitivity for most defects, high accuracy in locating defects and mostly used in reflection mode, which is important for complex and large aerospace components. Furthermore, due to focal plane array detector, a large area can be measured comparatively in much less time than ultrasound inspection. By measuring components (< 6 mm thickness) with thermography the load of water coupled ultrasonic machine can be relieved. Recently, for the first time FACC [2] has qualified thermography inspection method for CFRP components and has reduced the inspection time up to 50 %, although measurement is conducted manually. Already in 2012 [1], DLR Augsburg carried out the automated thermography measurement of an aircraft structure and published the results. Since then, both the automated measurement process and the evaluation process have been continuously improved. To reduce the evaluation process time by means of 3D visualisation model for a large number of 2D thermography images, 2 independent methods [3] are developed at DLR. A further development of the evaluation process for both methods occurred first by generating a 3D-thermo-tomography model [4] (Measurement results according to their thermal depth). The defect analysis with this generated model takes place directly in the CAD environment. Along with their development phase accuracy of system components for two methods were analysed [5] within the scope of those respective test series. Moreover, experiments were performed for complete evaluation (the absolute and relative system accuracy between two methods), and 3D thermography models were generated with both methods to analyse visualisation accuracy of 3D model in CAD environment.

	abstract = {Abstract In today's society, the customer driven markets has led to the rapid developments and continuous evolution of manufacturing technologies. The ability to accurately produce complex parts, and to reuse and remanufacture used parts is becoming more prevalent, requiring more efficient and rapid methods to be developed. One such method being currently developed is the hybrid process combining additive, subtractive and inspection processes for the manufacture of complex part geometries from any given raw material in terms of shape and size. A major element of the hybrid process is decomposition of a part into a number of subparts, which are additively manufactured and machined in sequence. However, the residual stresses resulting from the temperature difference between the solidified material (i.e. already manufactured subparts) and the material being deposited (i.e. new subparts being built) leads to part distortions, which significantly reduces the dimensional accuracy of finished parts. This study investigates part distortions that take place in the additive manufacturing process under the context of hybrid manufacturing. A method for conducting this investigation was first proposed. A mathematical model was developed, identifying the influential parameters that contribute to part distortions. These parameters were then incorporated in the experimental design by employing the Taguchi design of experiments strategy. Distortion behaviour arising from thermally induced stress was experimentally explored, indicating that part length, height, and layer thickness have significant effects on part distortions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

Until recently, the industry lacked an adequate first principles description of sensitivity to defect penetration and size, including the foundational cases of circular and elliptical defects. An inversion method has been developed and validated with independent synthetic and lab data. The data was obtained using an analytical forward model, finite element modeling, and laboratory data from different thickness and diameter pipes with known machined defects of different sizes and penetrations. The approach enables inverting field data to reconstruct 3D defect profiles, which helps to assess casing health and offers valuable information to the decision-maker for well integrity.

	abstract = {PIGs (pipeline inspection gauges) have been the main equipment for pigging, inner inspecting operations in oil and gas pipelines. Due to the insurmountable shortcomings of conventional sealing discs, it is impossible to actively control the PIG when it is running on the pipeline, which leads to no way when the PIG is stuck. In this study, a new type of bio-inspired sealing disc was designed in combination with the webbed foot structure of animals (e.g., bird, frog, duck), soft robot technology and the conventional sealing disc, adding a new way to the mechanical pigging method. And the 3D printing technology was used to print the sample of the bio-inspired sealing disc, taking into account the new direction of manufacturing the PIG. Then, effects of the interference (δ), clamping rate (ζ), webbed foot thickness (tw) and the number of webbed foot (N) of the bio-inspired sealing disc on the contact force and stress were studied using MSC Marc 2016 when the PIG was in pipe. The simulation results show that the contact force and stress on the bio-inspired sealing disc are not uniform, showing a great difference in the uniform contact force and stress on the conventional sealing disc. The effect of interference and clamping rate on the maximum contact force, stress on the bio-inspired sealing disc and the influence on the conventional sealing disc are basically the same, but the impact on the minimum stress and contact force is different. The thickness of the webbed foot has the greatest influence on the contact force, stress on the bio-inspired sealing disc, and the number of the foot has the least influence. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In this study, a simple thickness evaluation method was proposed for corroded roadlighting poles based on thickness measurement results of a dismantled road-lighting pole which had been used for about 40 years. The remaining thickness in cross-section of this specimen was measured by using both of Ultrasonic Thickness Gauge (UTG) and 3D portable laser scanner in order to investigate the accuracy of average thickness which could be obtained from only 4 measuring points at intervals of 90 degrees in circular cross-section. In this UTG measurement, the smoothing process, which will be carried out ordinarily by using electric grinder around measuring points, was abbreviated from the considering of labor-saving and additional thickness loss. From the measurement results, UTG measurement under the condition of no smoothing process will overestimate the actual remaining average thickness depending on surface roughness due to corrosion. Finally, an example of simple thickness evaluation, which uses average thickness and standard deviation based on only four measuring points, was shown for more reasonable UTG inspection of corroded road-lighting poles.

	abstract = {Background and Objective Artificial skin phantoms have been developed as an alternative tissue for human skin experiments due to convenient use and easy storage. However, fabricating both thin (∼100 μm) epidermis and relatively thick dermis is often cumbersome, and most developed phantoms have hardly reflected specific human skin types. The objective of this study was to fabricate skin phantoms with 3D printing technique to emulate various human skin types (I-VI) along with the corresponding optical and mechanical properties for laser tattoo removal. Study Design/Materials and Methods Both gelatin and agar powders were mixed with coffee and TiO2 particles to fabricate skin phantoms with materials properties for various skin types (I-VI). A 3D printer was employed to precisely control the thickness of each phantom for epidermis and dermis layers. A number of concentrations of the coffee and TiO2 particles were used to determine the degree of absorption and scattering effects in various skin types. The optical properties between 500 and 1,000 nm for the fabricated phantoms were measured by double-integrating spheres with an inverse adding-doubling (IAD) algorithm. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and rheometer were also utilized to evaluate optical (absorption and reduced scattering coefficients) and mechanical properties (compression modulus) of the fabricated phantoms, respectively. Results Visible color inspections presented that the skin phantoms for types I, III, and VI similarly emulated the color space of the human skin types. The optical property measurements demonstrated that the absorption (μa) and reduced scattering (μs′) coefficients decreased with wavelengths. Compared to the human skin type VI, a dermis phantom represented quite equivalent values of μa and μs′ whereas an epidermis phantom showed up to 30% lower μa but almost identical μs′ over the wavelengths. The OCT measurements confirmed that the thicknesses of the epidermis and the dermis phantoms were measured to be 138.50 ± 0.01 μm and 0.81 ± 0.04 mm, respectively. The mechanical properties of the phantoms mixed with the agar volume of 40% yielded a compression modulus of 83.7 ± 14.8 kPa, which well corresponded to that of human forearm skin (50-95 kPa). Conclusion The 3D printing technique was able to reliably fabricate the double-layered phantoms emulating a variety of skin types (I-VI) along with the comparable optical and mechanical properties. Further investigations will incorporate artificial chromophores into the fabricated skin phantoms to reliably evaluate the new therapeutic wavelengths for laser tattoo removal. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {This work presents a method of characterising pipeline defects using a small number of radiographs taken at different angles around the pipe. The method relies on knowledge of the setup geometry and use of multiple images, and does not require calibration objects to be included in the setup. It is aimed at use in situations where access is difficult such as in subsea pipeline inspections. Given a set of radiographs, a background subtraction method is used to extract defects in the images. Using a ray tracing algorithm and knowledge of the experimental setup, the range of possible locations of the defect in 3D space is then calculated. Constraints are applied on potential defect shapes and positions to further refine the defect range. The method is tested on simulated and experimental flat bottomed hole defects and simulated corrosion patch defects with lateral and axial sizes ranging from 12.5 to 33.8 mm and thickness between 3 mm and 16 mm. Results demonstrate a good, consistent ability to calculate lateral and axial defect dimensions to within ±3 mm of the true size. Defect thickness calculations are more difficult and as such errors are more significant. In most cases defect thickness is calculated to within 4 mm of the actual value, often closer. Errors in thickness are due to overestimation, meaning the calculation could be used to place a maximum limit on potential defect size rather than as an actual estimate of the thickness. This would still be useful, for example in deciding whether a defect requires further investigation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Beads were an important form of personal ornamentation in southern Levantine Pre-Pottery Neolithic societies and hold information on symbolic practices and exchange networks engaged by these communities. Establishing the exact mineralogical composition of stone beads and the precise methods used to manufacture beads are key to documenting shifts in these systems, but so far visual inspection has served as the primary mode of analysis for most assemblages. Here, we apply XRD and 3D digital optical microscopy to investigate raw material selection and bead manufacture at the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) settlement of el-Hemmeh, Jordan. Analyses reveal that PPNA bead assemblages emphasize the color green but included a wide variety of mineral types. The LPPNB assemblage exhibits a greater diversity in shape and color, including an emphasis on the use of red minerals, but consist of a more restricted range of minerals and lack the rectangular beads found in the PPNA. Color rather than suitability of material properties for bead making appears to have motivated choices for mineral selection. Bidirectional perforation was codified into the technological system and was consistently used to produce beads during the PPNA regardless of their size, thickness, or hardness. © 2018},

	abstract = {One of the great strengths of X-ray computed tomography over conventional inspection methods (ultrasound, thermography, radiography) is that it can image damage in 3D. However for curved or deformed composite panels it can be difficult to automatically ascribe the damage to specific plies or inter-ply interfaces. An X-ray computed tomography (CT) data processing methodology is developed to extract the through-thickness distribution of damage in curved or deformed composite panels. The method is applied to [(0°/90°)2]s carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) panels subjected low velocity impact damage (5 J up to 20 J) providing 3D ply-by-ply damage visualisation and analysis. Our distance transform approach allows slices to be taken that approximately follow the composite curvature allowing the impact damage to be separated, visualised and quantified in 3D on a ply-by-ply basis. In this way the interply delaminations have been mapped, showing characteristic peanut shaped delaminations with the major axis oriented with the fibres in the ply below the interface. This registry to the profile of the panel constitutes a significant improvement in our ability to characterise impact damage in composite laminates and extract relevant measurements from X-ray CT datasets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Cubic samples of hybrid Ni/Al open-cell foam with an edge length of 15 mm were investigated by the DECT measurement. The material was prepared using AlSi7Mg0.3 aluminium foam with a mean pore size of 0.85 mm, coated with nanocrystalline nickel (crystallite size of approx. 50 nm) to form a surface layer with a theoretical thickness of 0.075 mm. CT imaging was carried out using state-of-the-art DSCT/DECT X-ray scanner developed at Centre of Excellence Telč. The device consists of a modular orthogonal assembly of two tube-detector imaging pairs, with an independent geometry setting and shared rotational stage mounted on a complex 16-axis CNC positioning system to enable unprecedented measurement variability for highly-detailed tomographical measurements. A sample of the metal foam was simultaneously irradiated using an XWT-240-SE reflection type X-ray tube and an XWT-160-TCHR transmission type X-ray tube. An enhanced dual-source sampling strategy was used for data acquisition. X-ray images were taken using XRD1622 large area GOS scintillator flat panel detectors with an active area of 410 x 410 mm and resolution 2048 x 2048 pixels. Tomographic scanning was performed in 1,200 projections with a 0.3 degree angular step to improve the accuracy of the generated models due to the very complex microstructure and high attenuation of the investigated material. Reconstructed data was processed using a dual-energy algorithm, and was used for the development of a 3D model and voxel model of the foam. The selected parameters of the models were compared with nominal parameters of the actual foam and showed good correlation. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab srl.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore the application of computer-aided design and rapid prototyping (CAD/RP) for removable partial denture (RPD) frameworks and evaluate the fitness of the technique for clinical application. Materials and Methods: Three-dimensional (3D) images of dentition defects were obtained using a lab scanner. The RPD frameworks were designed using commercial dental software and manufactured using selective laser melting (SLM). A total of 15 cases of RPD prostheses were selected, wherein each patient received two types of RPD frameworks, prepared by CAD/RP and investment casting. Primary evaluation of the CAD/RP framework was performed by visual inspection. The gap between the occlusal rest and the relevant rest seat was then replaced using silicone, and the specimens were observed and measured. Paired t test was used to compare the average thickness and distributed thickness between the CAD/RP and investment casting frameworks. Analysis of variance test was used to compare the difference in thickness among different zones. Results: The RPD framework was designed and directly manufactured using the SLM technique. CAD/ RP frameworks may meet the clinical requirements with satisfactory retention and stability and no undesired rotation. Although the average gap between the occlusal rest and the corresponding rest seat of the CAD/RP frameworks was slightly larger than that of the investment casting frameworks (P < .05), it was acceptable for clinical application. Conclusion: RPD frameworks can be designed and fabricated directly using digital techniques with acceptable results in clinical application. © 2017 by Quintessence Publishing Co Inc.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Computed tomography scanning of the lumbar spine incurs a radiation dose ranging from 3.5 mSv to 19.5 mSv as well as relevant costs and is commonly necessary for spinal neuronavigation. Mitigation of the need for treatment-planning CT scans in the presence of MRI facilitated by MRI-based synthetic CT (sCT) would revolutionize navigated lumbar spine surgery. The authors aim to demonstrate, as a proof of concept, the capability of deep learning–based generation of sCT scans from MRI of the lumbar spine in 3 cases and to evaluate the potential of sCT for surgical planning. METHODS Synthetic CT reconstructions were made using a prototype version of the “BoneMRI” software. This deep learning–based image synthesis method relies on a convolutional neural network trained on paired MRI-CT data. A specific but generally available 4-minute 3D radiofrequency-spoiled T1-weighted multiple gradient echo MRI sequence was supplemented to a 1.5T lumbar spine MRI acquisition protocol. RESULTS In the 3 presented cases, the prototype sCT method allowed voxel-wise radiodensity estimation from MRI, resulting in qualitatively adequate CT images of the lumbar spine based on visual inspection. Normal as well as pathological structures were reliably visualized. In the first case, in which a spiral CT scan was available as a control, a volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) of 12.9 mGy could thus have been avoided. Pedicle screw trajectories and screw thickness were estimable based on sCT findings. CONCLUSIONS The evaluated prototype BoneMRI method enables generation of sCT scans from MRI images with only minor changes in the acquisition protocol, with a potential to reduce workflow complexity, radiation exposure, and costs. The quality of the generated CT scans was adequate based on visual inspection and could potentially be used for surgical planning, intraoperative neuronavigation, or for diagnostic purposes in an adjunctive manner. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2020.10.FOCUS20801 © 2021. except where prohibited by US copyright law.

	abstract = {The paper discusses thin part inspection using three-dimensional (3D) non rigid registration. The main objective is to match measurement point data to its nominal representation, so as to identify form defects. Since form defects have the same size order as the thickness of the part, establishing such matching is a challenging task. The originality of the method developed in this paper is using a deformable iterative closet point algorithm (ICP), and integrating modal approach to express form defects. The method described improves the matching through iteration of the ICP and establishes a definition of the error. The results of the application show that the present method is efficient. © Copyright 2018 by ASME.},

	abstract = {3D scanning technology uses lasers to scan and capture object surfaces without physical surface contact. Laser scanning is gaining acceptance by many, including owners of marine or offshore assets as a viable inspection and validation method. Laser technology reduces operational times compared to traditional pit gauging techniques, particularly for large areas of widespread wastage or pitting. This paper studies the use of 3D scanning technology for inspection, thickness gauging, and steel wastage measurements of hull structures. Pilot tests were conducted on coated and uncorroded plates in Houston, USA, and uncoated and corroded plates and uncoated and deformed plates in Perth, Australia. Manual Ultrasonic Testing (UT) was conducted, which is the method currently accepted by International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) for thickness measurements of hull structures. For the coated plate, the coating thickness was measured on both sides of the plate. The coating thickness was deducted from the total thickness from 3D scanning before the plate thickness was compared with the UT results. Acceptance criteria are proposed to compare the Manual UT measurements with the 3D scanning measurements to determine if 3D laser scanning is a possible alternative thickness measurement method. The difference of thickness measurements from 3D scanning on coated and uncorroded plates is within 13% when compared with those from UT. The discrepancy is attributed to equipment accuracy tolerances, errors from data post-processing, and measurement errors due to coating surface roughness. For uncoated and corroded plates, the difference reduces to 3%, making the results of 3D scanning acceptable based on acceptance criteria. In addition, the higher accuracy of using 3D scanning to measure plate deformation is demonstrated over traditional methods which use stringlines or laser levels to create a reference surface. Comparisons of the coefficient of variation (CV) on all plates demonstrate the higher precision of 3D scanning technology than that of manual UT. The main limitation of 3D laser scanners is their inability to directly obtain steel thickness for structures that have been coated or painted, especially in watertight/oil-tight structures. The study identifies capabilities, accuracy, and limitations of using 3D scanning technology for thickness measurements of hull structures in the marine or offshore industries. Scanning technology can support inspections providing fast and precise means of thickness measurements of corroded plates without coating. It provides the potential for producing 3D models and analysis for follow-up inspections. Plausible use cases in the maritime industry include defect analysis, fitness for service assessment, damage assessment, and corrosion monitoring. © 2021 by ASME},

One of the major concerns during layup process is the accidental occurrence of inclusions like release film, pre-preg backup film etc., Presently, inclusions are detected through visual inspection by clean room inspector. As these inclusions are very thin, they may go unnoticed by the inspector. These inclusions can cause delamination or disbonds during the service life of an aircraft leading to the rejection of component resulting in loss of time and money. This raises requirement for a semi-automated/automated system to detect inclusion in a faster, efficient and reliable manner during layup process.

	abstract = {The blades are an important part of gas turbines and internal defects, such as cracks and holes, can occur in some gas turbine blades. Due to the harsh working environment, these defects have a great influence on the safe operation of the gas turbine in practical applications. In this paper, a new method based on a digital radiography (DR) system is adopted to detect defects in gas turbine blades. Considering the limited size of the flat-panel detector in a DR system and the uneven thickness distribution of the irregular-shaped gas turbine blades, a region segmentation-based inspection method is presented in this paper. That is, the gas turbine blade is divided into a few regions using lead wires and the DR system is then used to inspect these sub-regions. Considering the high cost and low eficiency limitations of high-power computed tomography (CT) and traditional film-based radiographic testing (RT), certain image processing methods are adopted to accurately automate the extraction and analysis processes. A cubic polynomial interpolation background subtraction method is adopted for the accurate extraction of defects. In addition, a finite element method is presented to obtain the 3D parameter (the volume) of a defect from its 2D radiographic image. Experimental results show that the proposed method can eficiently estimate the 2D and 3D geometric parameters of defects in gas turbine blades at a low cost. The method is particularly suitable for offline X-ray inspection of gas turbine blades.},

	abstract = {For the inspection of large diameter pipes, particularly wastewater and stormwater systems, closed-circuit television (CCTV) is the commonly chosen inspection method. However, the long-term management of critical pipe infrastructure requires intelligent decisions made with detailed and quantitative data that CCTV cannot provide. With newly developed multisensor inspection (MSI) technologies, it is now possible to quantify the shape and size of pipes, and defects within them, in three dimensions (3D). Advancements in MSI methods allow for measurement of remaining wall thickness, detection of voids developing outside the pipe, and the creation of 3D digital point clouds with millimeter accuracy. By using these quantifiable measurements, a more accurate assessment of large water, wastewater, and stormwater pipes can be obtained, allowing the pipeline owner to accurately estimate remaining service life via these predictive models. Advancements in MSI technologies are highlighted in this paper, including 3D LiDAR, sonar, and pipe penetrating radar (PPR), and how to combine these technologies to collect comprehensive, quantitative data from large diameter pipes. Benefits of the technology will be demonstrated by recent case studies. The owner of a large, critical, and irregularly shaped sewer tunnel in Denver, Colorado, needed accurate dimensions in order to undertake the needed rehabilitation. The 7,580 ft long tunnel was inspected using multiple LiDAR devices, sonar, and a high-definition 360-degree CCTV camera deployed on a custom-built long-range inspection platform. This combination of sensors provided a detailed, accurate, and comprehensive report that was critical for an effective rehabilitation plan. The second case study illustrates how Melbourne, Australia, used a robotic, multisensor crawler to inspect critical sewer lines in the 23.5 to 37.5-in. range. These reinforced concrete pipes were inspected with pipe penetrating radar, LiDAR, and high-definition CCTV camera in order to design an effective asset management plan. The effectiveness, adaptability, and affordability of the described technologies allow asset managers to obtain comprehensive and actionable data that in turn are essential for effective asset management.  © 2021 ASCE.},

	abstract = {Reliable and quantitative non-destructive evaluation for small fatigue cracks, in particular those in hard-to-inspect locations, is a challenging problem. Guided waves are advantageous for structural health monitoring due to their slow geometrical decay of amplitude with propagating distance, which is ideal for rapid wide-area inspection. This paper presents a 3D laser vibrometry experimental and finite element analysis of the interaction between an edge-guided wave and a small through-thickness hidden edge crack on a racecourse shaped hole that occurs, in practice, as a fuel vent hole. A piezoelectric transducer is bonded on the straight edge of the hole to generate the incident wave. The excitation signal consists of a 5.5 cycle Hann-windowed tone burst of centre frequency 220 kHz, which is below the cut-off frequency for the first order Lamb wave modes (SH1). Two-dimensional fast Fourier transformation (2D FFT) is applied to the incident and scattered wave field along radial lines emanating from the crack mouth, so as to identify the wave modes and determine their angular variation and amplitude. It is shown experimentally and computationally that mid-plane symmetric edge waves can travel around the hole's edge to detect a hidden crack. Furthermore, the scattered wave field due to a small crack length, a, (compared to the wavelength l of the incident wave) is shown to be equivalent to a point source consisting of a particular combination of body-force doublets. It is found that the amplitude of the scattered field increases quadratically as a function of a/λ, whereas the scattered wave pattern is independent of crack length for small cracks a < < l. This study of the forward scattering problem from a known crack size provides a useful guide for the inverse problem of hidden crack detection and sizing. © 2017 by the authors.},

Both the interferometric phase and the spectral reflectance of thin films are monitored at the same time in order to obtain accurate thickness and top surface height of thin films, leading to the complete reconstruction of the 3D tomographic profile of thin films. To do that, information related to the layers of thin films and top surface height of thin films must be decoupled and, based on wavelet transform, allowing it to be achieved without introducing two troublesome measurement steps or spectral carrier frequency. The experimental results for a prepared specimen showed that thin film thickness profile could be determined within an error range of 9 nm compared to well-known techniques. Due to the rigorous approach used in the proposed method, it is well suited for the in-line high-speed inspection of microelectronic devices produced in large quantities as is done in the semiconductor and flat-panel display industries. © 2018, Korean Society for Precision Engineering and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {With the growth of 3D packaging technology and the development of flexible, transparent electrodes, the use of multilayer thin-films is steadily increasing throughout high-tech industries including semiconductor, flat panel display, and solar photovoltaic industries. Also, this in turn leads to an increase in industrial demands for inspection of internal analysis. However, there still remain many technical limitations to overcome for measurement of the internal structure of the specimen without damage. In this paper, we propose an innovative optical inspection technique for simultaneous measurements of the surface and film thickness corresponding to each layer of multilayer film structures by computing the phase and reflectance over a wide range of wavelengths. For verification of our proposed method, the sample specimen of multilayer films was fabricated via photolithography process, and the surface profile and film thickness of each layer were measured by two different techniques of a stylus profilometer and an ellipsometer, respectively. Comparison results shows that our proposed technique enables simultaneous measurements of the top surface and its underlying film surfaces with high precision, which could not be measured by conventional non-destructive methods. © The Author(s) 2017.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) semiconductor devices can address the limitations of traditional two-dimensional (2D) devices by expanding the integration space in the vertical direction. A 3D NOT-AND (NAND) flash memory device is presently the most commercially successful 3D semiconductor device. It vertically stacks more than 100 semiconductor material layers to provide more storage capacity and better energy efficiency than 2D NAND flash memory devices. In the manufacturing of 3D NAND, accurate characterisation of layer-by-layer thickness is critical to prevent the production of defective devices due to non-uniformly deposited layers. To date, electron microscopes have been used in production facilities to characterise multilayer semiconductor devices by imaging cross-sections of samples. However, this approach is not suitable for total inspection because of the wafer-cutting procedure. Here, we propose a non-destructive method for thickness characterisation of multilayer semiconductor devices using optical spectral measurements and machine learning. For > 200-layer oxide/nitride multilayer stacks, we show that each layer thickness can be non-destructively determined with an average of approximately 1.6 Å root-mean-square error. We also develop outlier detection models that can correctly classify normal and outlier devices. This is an important step towards the total inspection of ultra-high-density 3D NAND flash memory devices. It is expected to have a significant impact on the manufacturing of various multilayer and 3D devices. © The Author(s) 2021.},

Conventionally, methods such as micro computed tomography or scanning electron microscopy imaging have been applied to the measurement of geometric properties of porous material; however, high costs and low speeds make them unsuitable for analysing high volumes of components. Recent advances in the image-based analysis of open cell structures have opened up the possibility of qualifying variation in manufacturing of porous material. Here, a photogrammetric method of measurement, employing image analysis to extract values for geometric properties, is used to investigate the variation between identically designed porous samples measuring changes in material thickness and pore size, both intra- and inter-build. Following the measurement of 125 samples, intra-build material thickness showed variation of ±12%, and pore size ±4% of the mean measured values across five builds. Inter-build material thickness and pore size showed mean ranges higher than those of intra-build, ±16% and ±6% of the mean material thickness and pore size, respectively. Acquired measurements created baseline variation values and demonstrated techniques suitable for tracking build deviation and inspecting additively manufactured porous structures to indicate unwanted process fluctuations. © IMechE 2016.},

The exploitation of the results obtained makes it possible to carry out preventive maintenance to eliminate the hazards before a critical threshold of the dimensions of the hidden rust is reached.

	abstract = {Historically tools for determining the remaining thickness of metal within a well have suffered from some technical limitations. Tools indicating thickness by measuring magnetic properties have largely relied on permanent magnets; this has required tools to be matched to casing size and has limited their ability to pass through restrictions. Tools based on ultrasonic measurements are limited by the presence of gas, as the absence of a liquid phase does not provide sufficient energy coupling for signal transmission and detection. However, new developments in electromagnetic casing inspection technologies have resulted in a slim tool with multiple sensors that is capable of passing through restrictions and, while operating in several casing sizes, will operate in a wide range of well fluids. The tool generates an alternating magnetic field that travels outside the pipe being inspected. An array of twelve sensors detects localised information about the magnetic wave within the metal and this is used to generate a quantified log of remaining metal as well as used to provide 3D images of the casing thickness. Unlike other magnetic methods gradual thinning of the metal can be seen. The tool can be run with internal inspection methods such as multi-finger calipers to provide a total assessment of the condition of a well. © 2004, held jointly by the Society of Petrophysicists and Well Log Analysts (SPWLA) and the submitting authors.},

Due to the fact that destructive methods are not suitable for historical buildings of great architectural significance, a non-destructive method based on electrical tomography has been adopted. A hybrid tomograph with special sensors was developed for the measurements. This device enables the acquisition of data, which are then reconstructed by appropriately developed methods enabling spatial analysis of wet buildings. Special electrodes that ensure good contact with the surface of porous building materials such as bricks and cement were introduced. During the research, a group of algorithms enabling supervised machine learning was analyzed. They have been used in the process of converting input electrical values into conductance depicted by the output image pixels. The conductance values of individual pixels of the output vector made it possible to obtain images of the interior of building walls as both flat intersections (2D) and spatial (3D) images. The presented group of algorithms has a high application value. The main advantages of the new methods are: high accuracy of imaging, low costs, high processing speed, ease of application to walls of various thickness and irregular surface. By comparing the results of tomographic reconstructions, the most efficient algorithms were identified. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {In this study, we aimed to verify the accuracy of models created with the help of open-source Slicer 3.6.3 software (Surgical Planning Lab, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA) and the Mcor Matrix 300 paper-based 3D printer. Our study focused on the accuracy of recreating the walls of the right orbit of a cadaveric skull. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) of the skull was performed (0.25-mm pixel size, 0.5-mm slice thickness). Acquired DICOM data were imported into Slicer 3.6.3 software, where segmentation was performed. A virtual model was created and saved as an.STL file and imported into Netfabb Studio professional 4.9.5 software. Three different virtual models were created by cutting the original file along three different planes (coronal, sagittal, and axial). All models were printed with a Selective Deposition Lamination Technology Matrix 300 3D printer using 80 gsm A4 paper. The models were printed so that their cutting plane was parallel to the paper sheets creating the model. Each model (coronal, sagittal, and axial) consisted of three separate parts (∼200 sheets of paper each) that were glued together to form a final model. The skull and created models were scanned with a three-dimensional (3D) optical scanner (Breuckmann smart SCAN) and were saved as.STL files. Comparisons of the orbital walls of the skull, the virtual model, and each of the three paper models were carried out with GOM Inspect 7.5SR1 software. Deviations measured between the models analysed were presented in the form of a colour-labelled map and covered with an evenly distributed network of points automatically generated by the software. An average of 804.43 ± 19.39 points for each measurement was created. Differences measured in each point were exported as a.csv file. The results were statistically analysed using Statistica 10, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. The average number of points created on models for each measurement was 804.43 ± 19.39; however, deviation in some of the generated points could not be calculated, and those points were excluded from further calculations. From 94% to 99% of the measured absolute deviations were <1 mm. The mean absolute deviation between the skull and virtual model was 0.15 ± 0.11 mm, between the virtual and printed models was 0.15 ± 0.12 mm, and between the skull and printed models was 0.24 ± 0.21 mm. Using the optical scanner and specialized inspection software for measurements of accuracy of the created parts is recommended, as it allows one not only to measure 2-dimensional distances between anatomical points but also to perform more clinically suitable comparisons of whole surfaces. However, it requires specialized software and a very accurate scanner in order to be useful. Threshold-based, manually corrected segmentation of orbital walls performed with 3D Slicer software is accurate enough to be used for creating a virtual model of the orbit. The accuracy of the paper-based Mcor Matrix 300 3D printer is comparable to those of other commonly used 3-dimensional printers and allows one to create precise anatomical models for clinical use. The method of dividing the model into smaller parts and sticking them together seems to be quite accurate, although we recommend it only for creating small, solid models with as few parts as possible to minimize shift associated with gluing. © 2015 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.},

This study discusses the type of welding used in the industry, mainly involving the pipeline welds. On-demand need to every work process when finishing weld requires quality tests to ensure compliance to the standards required. Monitoring through the display image has long been used in Non-Destructive Testing (NDT). Various methods of monitoring used in NDT focused on Ultrasonic Tomography (UT) as a method used in NDT and as an option for the future. Previous imaging result was in two-dimensional (2D) and then upgraded to a three-dimensional image (3D). Besides, there is potential of 3D imaging beyond the existing limits in terms of size, material thickness, especially for welding steel pipes. Achievement through research of existing pipe size so far outside diameter of 200 mm and a thickness of 5.8 mm should be limited in view of the obstacles to enhanced image resolution is less effective when compared to other tomography methods. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press.

	abstract = {Purpose The aim of this study was to compare a developmental optical coherence tomography (OCT) based contact lens inspection instrument to a widely used geometric inspection instrument (Optimec JCF), to establish the capability of a market focused OCT system. Methods Measurements of 27 soft spherical contact lenses were made using the Optimec JCF and a new OCT based instrument, the Optimec is830. Twelve of the lenses analysed were specially commissioned from a traditional hydrogel (Contamac GM Advance 49%) and 12 from a silicone hydrogel (Contamac Definitive 65), each set with a range of back optic zone radius (BOZR) and centre thickness (CT) values. Three commercial lenses were also measured; CooperVision MyDay (Stenfilcon A) in −10D, −3D and +6D powers. Two measurements of BOZR, CT and total diameter were made for each lens in temperature controlled saline on both instruments. Results The results showed that the is830 and JCF measurements were comparable, but that the is830 had a better repeatability coefficient for BOZR (0.065 mm compared to 0.151 mm) and CT (0.008 mm compared to 0.027 mm). Both instruments had similar results for total diameter (0.041 mm compared to 0.044 mm). Conclusions The OCT based instrument assessed in this study is able to match and improve on the JCF instrument for the measurement of total diameter, back optic zone radius and centre thickness for soft contact lenses in temperature controlled saline. © 2016 British Contact Lens Association},

Especially, optical scanning method is used mostly as a non-contact scanning technique in manufacturing field. However, it can be influenced from surface characteristics such as transparency and reflectivity. To resolve these problems, various coating techniques have been studied for years. Among them, atomization-based coating method is one of the key technologies to change its characteristics before scanning the objects. In this study, atomization-based spray coating system is developed for producing a uniform thin layer. Then, a series of experiments are conducted to evaluate the coating performance with the developed coating system. As a result, after coating the surface of transparent and shiny target objects: glass slide, colour sample, cell cover, and clutch lever, 3D scanning results show that a uniform coating of target objects is significantly improved. Its coating thickness is less than 1 μm which means that it is important to keep the geometry unchanged of the part. Copyright © The Korean Society for Precision Engineering.},

In particular it is of interest to distinguish between the effects of the local temperature distribution, the effects of the local concentration of the moderator's chemical or structural components and the effects of the cladding material property variations to better interpret inspection results of fuel assemblies and to improve conclusions for design optimization. Since local parameters cannot be measured during operation, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is the method of choice to calculate the local fuel rod conditions. For example, the movement of discrete, virtual particles in the moderator can today already be simulated by a Lagrangian model with the particle tracking approach for CRUD deposition simulation. The development of a reference 3D PWR corrosion and CRUD deposition model was started which can calculate local parameters on a fuel rod surface to predict oxide thickness and component deposition taking into account the mixing effects during the moderator transport. The calculated 2D surface coolant temperatures were coupled to a dedicated fuel rod corrosion model, covering the full fuel rod in azimuthal and axial direction. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The presidential palace of India was constructed between the years 1912 to 1929 CE in a novel architectural style resulting from an amalgamation of Colonial and traditional Indian styles. During a visual inspection of this double-domed structure, meridional cracks were spotted in two out of the four niches in the drum of the lower dome. The observed distress raised two important issues that needed to be resolved- the cause of the cracks and their impact on the structural response. The uncertainty in the actual geometry of the building and the variety of materials used in its construction, the complex layout, lack of prior knowledge of reinforcement details and the undocumented changes made to the structure prompted the adoption of a multi-disciplinary scientific investigation to evaluate the structure. The methodical approach encompassed a literature review of dome failures in the past, historical and geometrical surveys, foundation inspection and the use of relevant non-destructive and minor destructive tests in the evaluation of the superstructure. The information gained from the aforementioned investigation was useful in the development of a 3D finite element model of the structure. The findings of the investigation revealed that owing to its geometry, tensile stresses develop in the unreinforced brick masonry drum. The reduction in the thickness of the drum at the locations of the niches results in an inherent weakness in the structure. The opening for the stairwell in the north-eastern corner of the building, at the level of the drum, further reduces the tensile resistance of the abutment system of the dome and gives rise to the observed crack pattern © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Using optical 3D digitisation for dimensional and shape inspection of work-pieces became a trend recently. Before a 3D scanning process starts, surface of the measured part must usually be coated with a thin layer of anti-reflective material. Such surface coating can be performed by means of a wide range of products with various composition and application method. It is however important to know how the matt coating affects the quality and accuracy of digitization, what the structure and thickness of a coating are. The thickness of a coating may vary significantly from product to product and according to our research, it ranges between units and hundreds of µm. This article presents results of an extensive research of seven matt coating products commonly used in practice. The measurement was carried out on cylindrical and spherical elements using ATOS optical 3D scanner and an electron microscope. Thereafter, the measurement results were analysed to define how the applied coating product along with the material of measured object affect the work-piece dimensional properties. The ease of coating removal was evaluated in the research as well. © 2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

Three dimensional finite element (3D-FE) modeling has been performed to optimize the magnetizing unit and inter-coil spacing of bobbin coils used for axial magnetization of the tube. The performance of the technique has been evaluated experimentally by measuring the axial (Ba) component of the leakage fields from localized machined defects in SG tubes. The MFL technique has shown capability to detect and image tube outside defects with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) better than 6 dB. Study reveals that Inconel support plates surrounding the SG tubes do not influence the MFL signals. As the MFL technique can detect localized defects in the presence of support plates as well as sodium and the remote field eddy current technique is sensitive to distributed wall thinning, their combined use will ensure comprehensive inspection of the SG tubes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

The CMUT-FET consists of a mechanical CMUT part and an electrical sensing FET part. The device has a characteristic of a shared gate dielectric between a CMUT and an FET; hence, the gate capacitance change in the CMUT part can be reflected to the FET current as pressure changes. With an FET's current amplifying characteristic, the CMUT-FET makes it possible to achieve higher sensitivity and high resonant frequency with smaller element pitch and smaller active cell area than existing CMUTs. Combination of a 3-D finite element analysis (FEA) model of the CMUT part and a commercial technology computer aided design (TCAD) simulation of the FET device was used for inspection of the CMUT-FET device performance. In the 3-D FEA simulation, we focused on investigating pull-in voltage and electrical potential of a rectangular CMUT plate which have 20MHz resonant frequency in immersion with different dimensions. The FET part simulation was performed with variation of gate oxide thickness, source/drain doping concentration, channel doping concentration, substrate doping concentration. We combined data and inspected overall device performance with pressure variation at specific gate voltage and optimized the factor above-mentioned to get high sensitivity. Simulation results show that the optimized model has the collapse voltage of 13.4V and the pressure sensitivity of 11.34μA/Pa at gate voltage of 11V. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Holographic tomography (HT) enables nondestructive, quantitative measurement of three-dimensional refractive index distribution of transparent, weakly-scattering micro-samples. The method has been successfully applied for inspection of technical objects, as well as biomedical specimens. The key element of the HT measurement is acquisition of multiple holograms corresponding to various projection directions. In the conventional configuration of HT, this is achieved by rotating a sample, which provides high and almost isotropic resolution of tomographic imaging. However, the major disadvantages of this configuration is degradation of the reconstruction quality due to inaccuracies of the sample rotation. In this paper, we propose a novel autofocusing solution, which enables compensation of the rotation errors in HT. The method utilizes cross-analysis of two optical fields that were registered for special combination of the illumination and rotation angles. The proper selection of these parameters ensures redundancy of information in the fields, which here is used for quantitative evaluation of the misalignment error. Notably, the proposed solution is fundamentally different than other alignment methods for HT. Those methods utilize autofocusing algorithms that assume a single in-focus plane of a sample. Contrarily, our solution does not disregard the 3D character of a sample and thus is compatible with tomographic measurements. The utility of the proposed alignment method is validated with numerical simulations using two examples of complex samples with large axial thickness: A set of beads and Shepp-Logan phantom. © 2018 SPIE.},

	abstract = {In this study, near-surface cracks in a railhead are inspected thoroughly using phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT). This research finds an alternative technique to inspect for near-surface cracks because the conventional non-destructive testing method for rail inspection lacks the capacity to inspect the near-surface crack profile. This study shows that PAUT can determine not only the crack depth but also the near-surface crack profile, so that the inspector can estimate the stage of crack growth and how the crack propagates. This information is valuable to the rail maintainer as one of the considerations for deciding the thickness of metal to remove when grinding the rail. In this study, after the measurement, the inspected region of the cracked railhead is sliced into thin pieces so that crack network information can be extracted. A 3D image reconstruction of the surface cracks based on the crack marks from all of the sliced rail pieces is performed. This image is then used as a reference to confirm the PAUT results. The results show that PAUT can clearly deliver crack profile estimation and provide an accurate estimation of a 3.51 mm crack-tip depth with an absolute error range of 8%-18%. The results also suggest that PAUT is a potential method for installation in a measurement train for near-surface crack inspection. © 2020 British Institute of Non-Destructive Testing.

	abstract = {Cement evaluation results are commonly presented in a standard two-dimensional (2D depth and azimuth vs. bond) log format, whereas casing inspection results may include three-dimensional (3D depth and azimuth with projected radius vs. thickness) images. The incorporation of 3D images supporting cement evaluation provides an enhanced visualization-based interpretation capability and improved decision making. The incorporation time-based surveillance monitoring (4D) with current casing evaluation techniques provides pipe integrity inspection solutions to operators that expands capabilities beyond current industry norms. Ultrasonic-based casing inspection and existing post-processing software creates multiple images, curves, spreadsheets, and statistics designed to pinpoint areas of casing damage. In addition, high-resolution passes could be made to create 3D images of the casing geometry, including portions with damage. Applying the same 3D imaging technique to cement evaluation enables increased comprehension of the cement sheath characteristics, particularly extending away from the immediate casing wall-cement contact. An analysis method was developed to evaluate the behavior of standard cement bond log (CBL) refracted waveforms and is applied directionally to the multiple waveforms from the segmented bond tools. This process enables a detailed interpretation of the entire cement sheath between the casing and formation. It is possible to detect channels or problem areas in the annular space with this new process. Building on these processing results, it is possible to create 3D images, along with cross-sectional views, that enable easy visualization of the annular volume. The results of the processing and resulting images help to illuminate inferior cement sheaths that do not provide the desired zonal isolation and help to determine the reasons for the unwanted fluid production. When managing riser inspection or monitoring casing wear, it is important to scrutinize changes in the pipe condition over time to meet governmental regulations. Visually comparing the logging runs is the standard legacy methodology, but this is extremely time-consuming, particularly when comparing large amounts of data. This paper demonstrates a new technique to observe these alterations of the pipe conditions over time, both on a depth-by-depth and joint-by-joint basis. This new 4D surveillance interpretation method, accepted by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), enables the operator to complete pipe inspections quickly and to continue drilling with confidence.

	abstract = {The complexity of historic constructions, with irregular geometry, inhomogeneous materials, variable morphology, alterations and damages, poses numerous challenges in the digital modeling and simulation of structural performances under different types of actions. Although recent developments in Building Information Modeling have introduced advanced simulation capabilities, the numerical characterization of historic buildings is still a challenging task for the lack of reliable procedures for structural simulation. This paper presents an innovative two-step methodology (Cloud-to-BIM-to-FEM) able to convert a historic BIM into a finite element model for structural simulation. The generation of the BIM (Cloud-to-BIM) is carried out with an accurate survey that integrates geometrical aspects, diagnostic analysis based on destructive and non-destructive inspections, material information, element interconnections, and architectural and structural considerations. The BIM is then turned into a finite element model (BIM-to-FEM) with a geometric rationalization which preserves irregularities and anomalies, such as verticality deviation and variable thickness. After setting material properties, loads, and boundary conditions, the structural simulation is run with a detailed model that respects the uniqueness and authenticity of the historic building, without the typical excessive geometric simplifications of the shape. A real case study is illustrated and discussed to prove that a rigorous Cloud-to-BIM-to-FEM workflow allows the generation of an accurate historic BIM from a set of laser scanning point clouds. Structural simulation was carried out with a 3D mesh derived from the BIM in order to take into consideration the geometrical irregularity of a castle. Here, the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach are illustrated and discussed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The integrity of reactor pressure vessel (RPV) is greatly affected by pressurized thermal shock (PTS). Once crack appears in the nozzle region, the stress concentration around the crack tips may lead to crack propagation, and finally cause a serious security problem. When the transient temperature is above the nil-ductility reference temperature, elastic–plastic constitutive relations are considered in the fracture mechanics analysis. The temperature-related properties of the materials are introduced into a 3-D finite element model to establish the temperature field and stress field of a real RPV. Since the test and safety inspection for RPV with defects under PTS loads are quite difficult and dangerous, the process of the ductile crack propagation is simulated by the extended finite element method (XFEM), and the critical crack sizes for different base wall thicknesses are determined. Then, the quantitative analysis of the effect of the crack position on the ultimate bearing capacity is carried out. For the crack tips with different shapes, the crack propagation law and the shape effect on the ultimate bearing capacity of the whole structure are also analyzed. According to their crack propagation paths and damage degrees, a good agreement is obtained. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper presents two turbomachinery-specific methods for profile tolerance assessment of compressor airfoils that process 3D scan data. This optical inspection technology digitizes the entire surface of the part into a triangulated mesh, which is aligned to nominal geometry and then processed to extract densely arranged profile sections. For the reverse engineering method, the profile sections are decomposed into thickness and camber distributions. These distributions and the camber line are used to identify the profile parameter vector of the reverse engineering model. The deviation of the actual geometry is obtained by subtracting its parameters from those of the nominal geometry. Parameter-span graphs reveal airfoil shape deviation and allow for quantification of blisk scatter. The design-like parameters are meaningful and enable an intuitive engineering judgement of the actual geometry deviation. The profile tolerance assessment method utilizes the camber line from the reverse engineering method to elegantly check against variable profile tolerance limits. The actual section is best-fitted to its nominal counterpart and assessed regarding its deviation relative to the allowed local tolerance. This ratio is plotted in a developed view summarizing the result of the profile tolerance assessment for the whole airfoil in a single graph. Thus, the condensed results allow for effective utilization of the high-resolution in airfoil sections. Ultimately, the paper widens the view from one airfoil towards the assessment of the entire blisk. The blisk data is presented by statistical processing of deviation fields of all airfoils, in terms of mean and standard deviation. These statistical quantities are plotted onto the airfoil contour to e.g. represent the average airfoil thickness of the blisk. The standard deviation plot points to airfoil sections of larger geometric scatter and reveals areas of a non-robust manufacturing process. Copyright © 2020 ASME.},

	abstract = {Casings can deform over the life of the well due to various reasons such as changing stress regimes, geological fault and fractures causing pinching, pressure differential created due to production, increased pressure due to injection, squeezing formations such as shale and salt, etc. A detailed casing deformation evaluation can provide insights to the operators in correlating the deformation to suitable reasons in their field. There are various methods to evaluate the innermost casing or tubing using ultrasonic and mechanical caliper measurements but there is no technology available to evaluate outer or second casing deformation without first retrieving the inner casing or tubing. This work introduces and encapsulates the novel methodology of transforming the outer or second casing third interface echo (TIE) response, obtained by advanced ultrasonic and flexural measurement inside innermost casing or tubing, into a 3D wellbore view to suitably visualize and analyze the outer or second string deformations. The work involves measuring the azimuthal radius and thickness of the innermost casing with the ultrasonic evaluation technique and computing the azimuthal annular distance between the two casings using the flexural wave TIE arrival time and its velocity in the annular fluid. The computed values are then combined to generate an array of azimuthal internal radius values of the outer or second casing and is finally converted into a 3D wellbore image for better and straight-forward visualization. To validate the methodology, a shop inspection test (SIT) was carried out where the dimensions of the inner and the outer casing were precisely measured with a mechanical caliper tool. Following that, ultrasonic and flexural measurement tool was run inside the innermost casing to obtain the response of both casings. The comparison showed a close match between the actual values and the measurements. Also, the 3D wellbore shape clearly showed the geometry of the outer string validating the methodology used in the creation of the 3D shape. The work can enable the operators to carry out time lapse outer string analysis on a periodic basis to give them early indications of any deformation in the outer or second string. This novel technique or methodology also has valuable application in plug and abandonment (P&A) where the inner tubing and casing retrieval can be hindered due to outer casing deformation. This technique can also help in designing the right drilling BHA for sidetracking based on the minimum ID of the outer pipe through which slot recovery or side-track has to be performed. © 2021, Offshore Technology Conference.

The two notches had a root radius of 0.45 mm, which imposes a multiaxial stress state and a state of high triaxiality in the net (minimal) section of the specimens. Tests were carried out until the failure occurred from one of the notches. The other one, unbroken but deformed under steady strain rate or steady load, was inspected using the Synchrotron Radiation Computed Tomography (SRCT) technique. These 3D through thickness inspections allowed the study of microstructural evolution at the peak stress for the monotonic tensile test and at the beginning of the tertiary creep for the creep tests. Cavitation features were assessed with a micrometre resolution within the notched region. Spatial distributions of void volume fraction (Vf) and void morphology were studied. Voiding mechanisms were similar under steady strain rates and steady loads. The maximum values of Vf were located between the axis of revolution of the specimens and the notch surface and voids were considered as flat cylinders with a circular basis perpendicular to the loading direction. A model, based on porous plasticity, was used to simulate the mechanical response of this PA6 material under high stress triaxiality.

	abstract = {Increased outsourcing of Integrated Circuit (IC) design and fabrication combined with malicious hardware security threats such as contactless optical probing have greatly decreased an attacker's difficulty in reverse engineering or maliciously modifying a given circuit. This has become a significant concern for the safety and security of the semiconductor industry. Physical inspection techniques have been used to validate the IC hardware integrity and detect security threats to address these concerns. However, most physical inspection methods for ICs rely upon removing unwanted epoxy packaging material without damaging the device under test (DUT). Therefore, the precise removal of the IC packaging guided by knowledge of the packaging structure is very important for efficiency and accuracy in this process. Currently, IC structure analysis depends on using high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT), which is time-consuming and lacks the spatial resolution necessary for characterizing advanced heterogeneous packages. For hardware assurance purposes, the entire volume of a device must be analyzed with high efficacy. Additionally, various packaging and the recently adopted 2.5D and 3D advanced packages bring more challenges to meet assurance requirements. Hybrid metrology, which is the combined use of inspection methods for characterization, has the potential to address the inspection challenges for advanced packaging. In this paper, a novel hybridized inspection method utilizing nondestructive THz time-domain spectrum (THz-TDS) and X-ray CT of the IC package is used to create a digital twin (DT) of the sample. The combined characterization can be leveraged to improve the efficiency and accuracy for high quality sample preparation. Hybrid inspection paired with automated sample preparation can reduce the time and operator input needed for complete verification of a large volume of samples. In this paper, the method of generating a digital twin of the IC internal regions of interest (ROI) will be introduced. Analysis of the generated digital twin is used to optimize the material removal necessary for IC verification without damaging the ROI. This inspection and removal methodology can be automated using boundary conditions from the design information of the IC package. Hybrid inspection provides the high spatial resolution thickness and geometry information for generating an automated material removal routine. This provides access to the sample's ROI for further FIB plasma delayering and SEM verification.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to introduce a novel method for the analysis of open cell porous components fabricated by laser-based powder bed metal additive manufacturing (AM) for the purpose of quality control. This method uses photogrammetric analysis, the extraction of geometric information from an image through the use of algorithms. By applying this technique to porous AM components, a rapid, low-cost inspection of geometric properties such as material thickness and pore size is achieved. Such measurements take on greater importance, as the production of porous additive manufactured orthopaedic devices increases in number, causing other, slower and more expensive methods of analysis to become impractical. Design/methodology/approach: Here the development of the photogrammetric method is discussed and compared to standard techniques including scanning electron microscopy, micro computed tomography scanning and the recently developed focus variation (FV) imaging. The system is also validated against test graticules and simple wire geometries of known size, prior to the more complex orthopaedic structures. Findings: The photogrammetric method shows an ability to analyse the variability in build fidelity of AM porous structures for use in inspection purposes to compare component properties. While measured values for material thickness and pore size differed from those of other techniques, the new photogrammetric technique demonstrated a low deviation when repeating measurements, and was able to analyse components at a much faster rate and lower cost than the competing systems, with less requirement for specific expertise or training. Originality/value: The advantages demonstrated by the image-based technique described indicate the system to be suitable for implementation as a means of in-line process control for quality and inspection applications, particularly for high-volume production where existing methods would be impractical. © 2018, Samuel Evans, Eric Jones, Peter Fox, Chris Sutcliffe.},

Besides this, there is a growing demand for new products, with more complex geometric design and production time shorter. Fortunately, nowadays we have more tools intended sheet metal forming simulation and reverse engineering like HyperWorks and Geomagic Design. In this paper a real case of electrical appliance component "Door Lining of an austenitic dishwasher" is discussed. The main objective is to develop a methodology to combine and evaluate several tools employed in the Reverse Engineering and the Forming Simu-lation.The basic steps used for conducting the door lining forming simulation, including the reverse engineering process, are given next. The process begins with the 3D scanning and point cloud processing to generate a CAD Surface; furthermore the cad model inspection and quick feasibility study for the blank development; besides that, the tools generations for the triple action draw to the incremental formability analysis; finally, the thickness comparison and whole deviation between the simulation results and the real part.},

	abstract = {Acardiac twinning is a rare anomaly of monochorionic twin pregnancies. Acardiac fetuses lack a functional heart but are passively perfused by arterial blood from their pump co-twin causing the acardiac body to be hypoxemic. In this report, we present an acardius anceps, therapeutically laser separated from its pump twin at 16 weeks. The healthy pump twin and macerated acardiac body were born at 40 3/7 weeks. A three dimensional (3D) reconstruction was made by CT images, showing cranial bones, spinal column, pelvis and lower extremities but absent arms. A cyst in the neck of the acardiac twin was identified by postnatal sonography; this was also described in four literature cases, and was additionally observed by us in two other acardiac twins. Median cleft palate was identified by oral cavity inspection but undetectable in the reconstruction. In the literature, we found 21 other acardiac anceps twins with a cleft palate. From the two larger published series, with 12 clefts in 21 acardiac anceps twins, a cleft palate occurs in over 50% during acardiac twinning. Our first hypothesis is that acardiac fetuses develop an oral cleft palate when acardiac onset starts prior to 11 weeks, because 11 weeks includes the period of embryonic oral cavity formation, and no cleft occurs when onset starts later than 11 weeks. Our second hypothesis is that cysts and cleft palates are more common in acardiac twins than currently known, likely reflecting that acardiac bodies are hypoxemic and that hypoxia contributes to the development of both cysts and clefts. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Purpose: In this study, we developed a 3D-printed deformable pelvis phantom for evaluating spatial DIR accuracy. We then evaluated the spatial DIR accuracies of various DIR settings for cervical cancer. Methods: A deformable female pelvis phantom was created based on patient CT data using 3D printing. To create the deformable uterus phantom, we first 3D printed both a model of uterus and a model of the internal cavities of the vagina and uterus. We then made a mold using the 3D printed uterus phantom. Finally, urethane was poured into the mold with the model of the internal cavities in place, creating the deformable uterus phantom with a cavity into which an applicator could be inserted. To create the deformable bladder phantom, we first 3D printed models of the bladder and of the same bladder scaled down by 2 mm. We then made a mold using the larger bladder model. Finally, silicone was poured into the mold with the smaller bladder model in place to create the deformable bladder phantom with a wall thickness of 2 mm. To emulate the anatomical bladder, water was poured into the created bladder. We acquired phantom image without applicator for EBRT. Then, we inserted the applicator into the phantom to simulate BT. In this situation, we scanned the phantom again to obtain the phantom image for BT. We performed DIR using the two phantom images in two cases: Case A, with full bladder (170 ml) in both EBRT and BT images; and Case B with full bladder in the BT image and half-full bladder (100 ml) in the EBRT image. DIR was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) and 31 landmarks for the uterus and 25 landmarks for the bladder. A hybrid intensity and structure DIR algorithm implemented in RayStation with four DIR settings was evaluated. Results: On visual inspection, reasonable agreement in shape of the uterus between the phantom and patient CT images was observed for both EBRT and BT, although some regional disagreements in shape of the bladder and rectum were apparent. The created phantom could reproduce the actual patient's uterus deformation by the applicator. For both Case A and B, large variation was seen in landmark error among the four DIR parameters. In addition, although DSCs were comparable, moderate differences in landmark error existed between the two different DIR parameters selected from the four DIR parameters (i.e., DSC = 0.96, landmark error = 13.2 ± 5.7 mm vs. DSC = 0.97, landmark error = 9.7 ± 4.0 mm). This result suggests that landmark error evaluation might thus be more effective than DSC for evaluating DIR accuracy. Conclusions: Our developed phantom enabled the evaluation of spatial DIR accuracy for the female pelvic region for the first time. Although the DSCs are high, the spatial errors can still be significant and our developed phantom facilitates their quantification. Our results showed that optimization is needed to identify suitable DIR settings. For determining suitable DIR settings, our method of evaluating spatial DIR accuracy using the 3D-printed phantom may prove helpful. © 2017 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

	abstract = {Failure analysis is crucial in improving semiconductor manufacturing yields. Yield improvement is done by collecting, analyzing, identifying the causes of defects, and applying corrective actions to resolve the root causes. With the ongoing miniaturization of TSVs, micro-bumps, RDLs, and other package interconnects [1], detecting defects in these buried interconnects is becoming more difficult as well as more important. Traditionally semiconductor packages are cross-sectioned to identify internal process defects such as unsolders, solder shorts, and pad misalignment. Cross-sectioning is a destructive approach, is difficult to do, and provides information in a single 2D plane only. Due to the large effort and the destructive nature of this approach, the amount of data that can be generated is typically quite limited. The development of 3D X-ray microscopy provides industry with the capability to image and analyze buried features such as micro-bumps, TSVs, and other metallic structures using a non-destructive, 3-dimensional technology [2]. At the same time, deep learning has revolutionized other technologies such as visual surveillance, predictive maintenance [3], object detection [4], and is now revolutionizing defect detection in semiconductors. When used together, the combination of 3D X-ray microscopy and deep learning is establishing a new paradigm in package inspection and metrology. In this paper, we will present a novel method for automatically detecting internal anomalies in semiconductor packages and using deep learning to assess the attributes of these interconnects. Chips representative of stacked 2.5D packages were fabricated and assembled using thermo-compression bonding. Bonding parameters were varied in order to create packages with different bond line thickness, different solder fillet shapes, and various pad alignment scenarios. A commercial 3D X-ray imaging tool was used to create high-quality tomographies of these packages. Deep-learning and computer vision-based methods were employed to automatically detect internal features and measure attributes. A three-step procedure was used for data analysis. In the first step, a bounding box was detected for each region of interest (Copper Pillar, Pad, etc.) using a modified single shot detector object model. In the second step, we isolated features within the region of interest and performed 3D segmentation on them. The third and final step utilized automated 3D metrology using the segmented regions. Robust 3D computer vision techniques were deployed to measure the extent of voids which are key attributes for the chip fabrication and process control step. This is the first part of a multi-part paper.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The recent development of industrial computer tomography (CT) has enabled inspection of the integrity of mechanical parts without physical sectioning. Using X-ray CT (XCT) presents many challenges prohibiting industry from widely implementing the technology. The existence of several variables such as filament current, filter material, and filter thickness is directly related to the presence of noise and influences the accuracy of the inspection process. Noise in the resultant reconstructed image is the result of low-energy X rays being absorbed by the detector causing large variations of brightness on the computer image; other noise sources such as detector variations and electronic noise are further sources of error. Additionally, the reconstruction method, which also has a response to the noise scatter, can contribute to the resulting image noise. The presence of noise can skew the resulting image and create the illusion of pores/defects that are not actually present, thus vastly compromising the results of the analysis. Noise reduction is vital in improving the reliability of CT imaging of additive manufactured components. This article investigates the possibility of reducing noise by using detector filters. The study will investigate the impact of source and detector filters (shown in fig. 1) on image quality. Two filter types of 100-μm-thick aluminum and 100-um-thick copper filters were used, and the results were compared to a conventional tube filter. The workpiece used in this study consisted of a 6-mm Ti6Al4V round bar with designed internal features ranging from 50 to 1,400 μm containing a mixture of voids, two filled with unfused powder and two unfilled. The diameter and depth of defects were characterized using focus variation microscopy and then scanned with a Nikon XTH225 industrial CT to compare the measured internal features. The analysis was carried out using VGStudio Max 3.0 (Volume Graphics, Germany) software package to evaluate surface determination and defects/porosity. Preliminary results indicate that using the aluminum detector filter can reduce the noise by 20 % when scanning the part under certain conditions. Also, for a low-magnification scan using the aluminum detector filter, no difference in noise was evident, but it was noted that the filament current could be reduced, potentially further reducing noise. © 2019 by ASTM International.},

	abstract = {The authors wish to make the following corrections to this paper [1]: (1) The title of the article should be changed so that the word ‘Quantitative’ is replaced with ‘Experimental’. (2) Section 3.3 should be removed and replaced with the following: 3.3. Thermographic Signal Reconstruction, The Thermographic Signal Reconstruction (TSR) is widely used in commercial pulsed thermography systems. In TSR, a polynomial function is fitted to each pixel time history to minimize temporal noise. Images created from the instantaneous logarithmic time derivatives of the fit function are typically viewed and analyzed, since the derivative images are much more sensitive to subsurface features than the original data sequence from the IR camera. Individual pixel time history derivatives can be evaluated quantitatively for automated evaluation or measurement of depth or thermal diffusivity. Once the polynomials have been calculated for each pixel, the coefficients may be archived instead of the original data sequence, resulting in a significant degree of data compression. The implementation of TSR that is used in industrial systems is based on patented and proprietary  technology that has optimized specifically for performance with other components in the system. In this study, we have used the basic form of TSR that has been reported in the literature, which we refer to as “B-TSR”. Our polynomial calculation is based on a standard Matlab polynomial fit. Results presented here using B-TSR do not necessarily represent the performance of commercial TSR systems. (3) The performance of the Thermographic Signal Reconstruction (TSR) method in the experimental study was misrepresented due to the lack of contrast optimization, which was performed on other images in Figure 3. The images 3d and 3e in Figure 3 should be replaced with the contrast optimized results, below: (4) Contrast optimization improves the relative performance of TSR for foreign object defect (FOD) detection, and significantly affects the results of the comparative study. To reflect this, the following sentences on page 5 should be omitted: 1. But PCT can provide the most inspection details and the best definition 2. According to the comparison of the images acquired from different image processing methods, PCT is the best solution for this type of defect using pulsed thermography, (5) The conclusions section should be modified: The sentence: “ For pulsed thermography and lock-in thermography, PCT can provide the best inspection results, since PCT is    both fast and effective” should be removed, and replaced with “Pulsed thermography with TSR or PCT processing, or lock-in thermography with PCT, all provided acceptable inspection results” (6) Table 4 should be removed and replaced with the updated table, below Table 4. Performance of thermographic methods. (Table Presented.)  (7) In Sections 4, 6 and 7, all occurrences of the word ‘TSR’ should be replaced with ‘B-TSR’. (8) Section 6 (“Thermographic Probability of Detection”) should be removed from the paper; (9) Table 4 should be moved to the Conclusion section. The caption should read “Performance of Thermographic Methods” (10) The word “probable” should be eliminated from the following sentence in Section 4.4: The sentence should read as follows: “This may indicate the existence of Defect E” (page 5). (11) The second paragraph in Section 4.4 should be modified to read as follows: The authors increased the heating times to 120 s for pulsed thermography experiments. However, the longer pulse did not provide better inspection results. This is understandable, since the duration of pulse heating should be set to accommodate the thickness and thermal diffusivity of the sample, and both the 30 and 120 s heating durations were significantly longer than the time required for heat to travel through the sample (~5 s). In particular, TSR is sensitive to transient events while heat is still passing through the sample, therefore the long heating periods and late acquisition used may have cancelled some positive effects of TSR. The authors apologize for any inconvenience caused to readers. The authors also apologize for the inconvenience caused by our misrepresentation of the TSR method. The manuscript will be updated and the original will remain online on the article webpage.

	abstract = {A comprehensive approach is presented to perform model-based inversion of crack characteristics using bolt hole eddy current (BHEC) techniques. Data was acquired for a wide range of crack sizes and shapes, including mid-bore, corner and through-thickness crack types, and from both standard eddy current hardware and a prototype BHEC system with z-axis position encoding. Signal processing algorithms were developed to process and extract features from the 2D data sets, and inversion algorithms using VIC-3D generated surrogate models were used for inverting crack size. New model results are presented, which now address the effect of having a corner crack at an edge and a through crack adjacent to two edges. A two-step inversion process was implemented that first evaluates the material layer thickness, crack type and location, in order to select the most appropriate VIC-3D surrogate model for subsequent crack sizing inversion step. Inversion results for select mid-bore, through and corner crack specimens are presented where sizing performance was found to be satisfactory in general, but also depend on the size and location of the flaw. © 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.},

	abstract = {X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging for industrial applications is limited to certain physical conditions to be fulfilled. The size of the measuring object and the accumulated wall thickness are two fundamental conditions. An omission of these conditions by not capturing object attenuation information by the x-ray detector leads to missing data in the 3D reconstruction process and results as a consequence in image degradation and artifacts. Conventional industrial x-ray CT is based on cone-beam projections and circular or helical scanning trajectories using linear axis and a rotary (lift) table. For many inspection tasks on big-sized or unusually shaped objects the physical limits for obtaining a sufficient high image quality are reached very quickly when using conventional CT systems. Industrial six-axis robots offer much more flexibility with respect to the conditions mentioned earlier and can overcome the limitations of conventional scanners. In the present work we characterized an industrial six-axis robot in its working space following ISO 9283 in terms of pose accuracy and pose repeatability. These results are then used to simulate faulty scanning trajectories in terms of pose deviations where a single robot is used as an object manipulator to rotate virtual specimens on a circular trajectory resulting in different (faulty) reconstruction datasets. These datasets are evaluated visually and by using performance parameters and geometrical features in order to determine the reproduction fidelity (performance) of a one arm robot-based CT system depending on different pose errors. With the results obtained it was shown that a robot-based CT system of type B (in our classification scheme) using one robot as object manipulator should be able to reach a spatial resolution power in the range of the voxel size (in our case 200 µm) and smaller (neglecting effects from focal spot size, detector unsharpness from x-ray to light conversation and scatter radiation) if systematic pose errors are compensated using appropriate calibration methods. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Thermal management is the critical issue in all present conventional 2D electronic packages, and is more crucial in the case staked dies of advanced 3D IC technology, because of increased power density and complex chip designs. The traditional methods are reaching their limits towards cooling requirement of 3D ICs. The liquid cooling micro-channel are the most attractive for high heat flux mitigation. However, the integration of such micro-channels across the stacked dies, is challenging. In this work, we are proposing a facile method of fabrication and integration of a high reliable, tight sealed inter-die microfluidic channels for 3D ICs. The integration of inter-die microchannel over three stacked layers has been developed with titanium silicide as a bonding interface by simultaneous application of optimal heat and force is matching towards CMOS compatibility. Here, we demonstrated the reaction mechanism of titanium (Ti) and importance of Ti thickness across the bonding interface. The temperature and load optimizations carried out using the surface profile of Ti using AFM before bonding, and interface inspection after bonding, by using, C-SAM and razorblade insertion. The interface reactions and thickness of Ti optimization has inspected using X-FESEM and EDS profile. After conforming void free high reliable bonding interface, at optimized conditions, we fabricated fine pitch (200 μ m) with 100 μm width and 40 μm depth micro-channels at inter-dies of three-layer stacked silicon structure using titanium as interlayer. Along with, we demonstrated the micro channel integration across the stacked wafers for future high performance 3D IC designs in a facile approach. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Since nickel-coated steel is widely used to prevent rust, it is used in large rolled steel plates in paper mills. It is necessary to inspect the thickness of the nickel layer on nickel-coated steel in the production process to guarantee quality. Moreover, in a real plant, the inspection of the nickel layer on the opposite side of a rolled steel plate is required. The conductivity of the nickel layer in the nickel-coated steel plate is higher than that of the mother steel, and its permeability is lower than that of the mother steel. Therefore, the thickness of the nickel layer can be estimated on the basis of the differences in these electromagnetic properties. In this paper, an electromagnetic inspection method for measuring the thickness of the nickel layer on the opposite side using a pulsed magnetic field is proposed. The detailed phenomenon of the inspection method is examined by the 3D nonlinear finite element method (FEM) considering the hysteresis magnetization curves of both nickel and the mother steel plate. It is shown that the electromagnetic inspection of the thickness of the nickel layer is possible by using the output voltage of a search coil of the proposed sensor. © MYU K.K.},

As water jet spot welding is a concise time welding process, numerical analysis can optimize it and examine the effect of input parameters on plastic deformation and stress distribution that would be difficult to measure experimentally. In this study, the entire water jet spot welding process of aluminum HS30 is modeled through ABAQUS/EXPLICIT based on an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation which helps to alleviate many of the traditional Lagrangian-based implementation drawbacks. Three-dimensional (3D) models are used to evaluate the effect of water jet velocity, flyer stand-off distance (SD), and flyer thicknesses during the process. The weld’s quality in terms of failure or success is also investigated by using stress and strain measures.

In this work, we propose using N-doped graphene (NG)/wax composites, where an interconnected 3D graphene network is used as filler in a wax matrix. Nitrogen atoms were substitutionally doped into the graphene lattice by hydrothermal method. It was found that controlling the amount of NG could effectively modulate the electrical properties of graphene. Inspection of the samples prepared showed that to a large extent, the vacuum infusion method effectively retained the graphene intact 3D structure. Samples filled with 3.6 wt% NG exhibited the most prominent microwave absorption properties; the minimum reflection loss registered was 53.25 dB at 13.10 GHz for a sample thickness of 3.3 mm, and the bandwidth of the reflection loss less than 10 dB (90% absorption) can reach up to 8.15 GHz. The result indicates that the nitrogen-doped graphene can greatly improve the dielectric loss of electromagnetic wave absorber. More importantly, the work presented provides the framework for a unique facile approach to manufacture low-cost NG/wax composites with strong electromagnetic wave absorption ability at very low filler loading. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

We have developed a high numerical aperture optical stent inspection system able to acquire both 2D and 3D images. Combining a rotational stage, an area camera with line-scan capability and a triple illumination arrangement, unrolled sections of the outer, inner, and sidewalls surfaces are obtained with high resolution. During stent inspection, surface roughness and coating thickness uniformity is of high interest. Due to the non-planar shape of the surface of the stents, the thickness values of the coating need to be corrected with the 3D surface local slopes. A theoretical model and a simulation are proposed, and a measurement with white light interferometry is shown. Confocal and spectroscopic reflectometry showed to be limited in this application due to stent surface roughness. Due to the high numerical aperture of the optical system, only certain parts of the stent are in focus, which is a problem for defect detection, specifically on the sidewalls. In order to obtain fully focused 2D images, an extended depth of field algorithm has been implemented. A comparison between pixel variance and Laplacian filtering is shown. To recover the stack image, two different methods are proposed: maximum projection and weighted intensity. Finally, we also discuss the implementation of the processing algorithms in both the CPU and GPU, targeting real-time 2-Million pixel image acquisition at 50 frames per second. © 2017 SPIE.},

	abstract = {In order to measure steel plate thickness and surface defects simultaneously, an online inspection method based on a grating projection is proposed in this paper. This method improves the projective mode and reduces fringe distortion compared to the original triangulation method. Meanwhile, through calibration of the sinusoidal fringe and the windowed Fourier transform (WFT) of a one-dimensional signal, the distorted fringe formed by modulating the grating fringe of steel plate thickness and surface defects can be processed. Finally, the three-dimensional shape of the steel plate can be reconstructed and, thus, the steel plate thickness and surface defects can be obtained. The experimental results show that this method can enhance inspection speed and ensure that the detection error is no more than ±0.03 mm. © 2018 Polish Psychiatric Association. All rights reserved.},

All the features are designed and located to be visually and geometrically accessible for inspection without removal from the base plate and to have high probability for successful printing among L-PBF platforms. Features from each of the 16 build plates were measured using optical and mechanical measurement methods and data compiled for a detailed evaluation of each feature.

	abstract = {Recent advancements in semiconductor three-dimensional (3D) packaging ignited the need for higher-precision surface metrology, especially for hybrid bonding. This study addresses the technological strength of white-light scanning interferometry (WSI) over atomic force microscopy (AFM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) for nano-meter-resolution hybrid bonding surface measurements/inspections. Two exemplary hybrid bonding samples were prepared for this comparative test with different chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) treatments – one maintaining a metallic tantalum thin-film and the other having an over-polished lower dielectric Tetraethyl Orthosilicate (TEOS) layer without tantalum thin-film, mimicking the copper protrusion. The same samples were measured by WSI and CLSM; the results were compared with the contact-type AFM measurement, the golden standard method in the industry. WSI reconstructed the surface profile similarly to the AFM and showed sub-nm repeatability with a standard deviation of 0.79 nm after 20 consecutive measurements, further supported by the Allan deviation analysis, proving that the system is not affected by non-stationary noise. Interestingly, the existence of a thin film does not affect the stability of the WSI system. CLSM could not appropriately reconstruct the surface profile, and repeatability was also evaluated to be lower than that of WSI. With the proper knowledge of the TEOS and Silicon Nitride thickness, through precision calculation of the phase spectrum change in Cu and Silicon Nitride, we can reconstruct the surface profile with high precision. Theoretical analysis and Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulation were also conducted for in-depth understanding about phase change effect on hybrid bonding sample. Based on these theories and simulations, the universality and sub-nm level accuracy of optical metrology for various bonding materials were verified. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {With the rise in demand for high aspect ratio hole etching in semiconductor device fabrication, developing efficient inspection methods to detect etching failures is increasingly vital. Such failures can compromise the reliability of electrical connections of contact holes in highly sophisticated 3D semiconductor geometries. In this study, we present a nanoscale inspection technique employing synchrotron-based scanning photoelectron microscopy (SPEM) to assess the electrical connectivity of contact holes. Samples were systematically prepared with an array of contact holes of varying sizes. To simulate etching failure, a residual silicon oxide layer was deliberately left to induce the binding energy shift in photoelectron peak positions due to electrical charging. By obtaining W 4f and Si 2p spectra for the W-filled and W-unfilled structures, respectively, we objectively determined the electrical states of the contact holes. With its focused X-ray beams, SPEM has demonstrated its suitability for investigating the electrical connectivity of individual contact holes at the nanoscale. SPEM possesses the additional capability of non-destructive imaging the thickness of buried insulators inside an individual contact hole. Our results cast potential application of SPEM as a nanoscale inspection methodology for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Inter-scanner variability hinders the direct comparability of multi-site/scanner MRI data for clinical research. The ComBat method is commonly used to reduce the variability based on an empirical Bayes framework1,2, harmonizing the data at the feature level (e.g., region-of-interest measures). However, directly harmonizing the scans at the voxel-level using ComBat has been relatively less explored. In this study, we investigated the performance of the voxel-wise ComBat. Also, going beyond voxels, we proposed a new ComBat approach which operates on a small group of voxels called superpixels3. Method: Eighteen subjects (10 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 8 controls; age: 68.0 [9.3] years; 10 females) participated in this study. For each subject, T1-weighted images were acquired on each of four 3T scanners with different manufacturers or models (i.e., GE, Philips, Siemens-Prisma, Siemens-Trio). After the standard image preprocessing including two-step registration by using the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12)4, the unharmonized scans (Raw data) were aligned in the standard template space. To reduce the computational load for ComBat at the voxel level (Voxel-ComBat), we used a three-dimensional superpixel algorithm3 to parcellate the images into hundreds of superpixels based on the study-specific template, and then the ComBat was applied at the superpixel level (Figure 1). Compared to Voxel-Combat operating on about half million voxels (computation time >>10,000 seconds), this superpixel ComBat (SP-ComBat) operates on only a few hundred superpixels, significantly improving the computation efficiency (computation time < 5 seconds) while maintaining the harmonization performance. The harmonized scans were used to estimate cortical thickness by employing surface-based morphometry5, and the coefficients of variation of thickness measures were calculated to evaluate the harmonization performance. Result: The harmonized data provided similar contrasts across scanners compared to the Raw images in visual inspection (Figure 2) and had comparable distributions of the tissue-specific signal intensity between scanners for both Voxel-ComBat and SP-ComBat (Figure 3). Also, these two methods significantly reduced the inter-scanner variation (both p-values < 0.001) in terms of cortical thickness measures (Figure 4). Conclusion: This study evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of Voxel-ComBat and proposed a new approach, SP-ComBat, to optimize the efficiency of ComBat harmonization at the voxel level. © 2022 the Alzheimer's Association.},

	abstract = {The laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process is strongly influenced by the characteristics of the powder layer, including its thickness and thermal transport properties. This paper investigates in-situ characterization of the powder layer using thermographic inspection. A thermal camera monitors the temperature history of the powder surface immediately after a layer of new powder is deposited by the recoating system. During this process, thermal energy diffuses from the underlying solid part, eventually raising the temperature of the above powder layer. Guided by 1D modeling of this heat-up process, experiments show how the parameterized thermal history can be correlated with powder layer thickness and its thermal conductivity. A neural network, based on the parameterized thermal history, further improves the correlation after training. It is used to predict the part distortion for an unsupported structure. This method detects serious part distortion several layers before the part breaks through the powder layer and interacts with the recoater. This approach can be automated to prevent catastrophic recoater crashes or abrasion of soft wipers and has the potential to monitor local properties of the powder layer in-situ. © 2022 The Authors},

We used practical data collected from the No.3 coal seam of the Yangquan Xinjing Mine in the Qinshui Basin for this study.Using the drill core data,the continuous observation of coal structure in excavated roadways,and the three-dimensional seismic results, we studied the distribution characteristics of soft coal in the coal seams.We analyzed the relationship between the distribution characteristics and other geological parameters,such as CBM occurrence,fracture system,sequence stratigraphic sandstone ratio before and after coal accumulation,and coal seam thickness.We also clarified the primary geological factors controlling tectonic coal development. In addition, we propose that the distribution of tectonic coal is controlled by the ternary coupling of abrupt changes in tectonics, peripheral rocks,and coal seams.On this basis,we extracted six seismic-geological characterization attributes that showed dominant effects on the tectonic coal distribution from the 3D seismic data and interpretation. We constructed a tectonic coal distribution prediction model incorporating multiple attributes using the gray correlation method. We then used this model to predict the distribution of soft coal in the No.3 coal seam in the testing area,and checked for the validity and feasibility of the method through excavation and CBM development well inspection,providing a novel approach for accurately predicting tectonic coal distribution. © 2023 Chinese Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma.

	abstract = {Polymeric thin films represent an emerging industrial area driven by their enormous technological and commercial potential in interdisciplinary sectors such as chemistry, material science, engineering, and physics. The large selection in terms of materials/composites and the wide range of technological solutions that could be used for their fabrication could create confusion for the final user requiring a quantitative characterization of their properties. This analysis could be even more complex in the case of functionalized polymeric films such as the samples reported in this work. Here we present how thin polymer films can be wholly characterized by applying a multiplicity of optical methods. Films were realized by a special liquid one-step process. Moreover, such polymer films were functionalized here for the first time by mesoporous silica nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were added to a polymeric matrix. We show that a full characterization was achieved by employing three different microscope techniques, i.e., scanning electron microscope, digital holography (DH), and space-time DH. Exploiting such a multimodal methodology can be of great benefit for characterizing the functionalized polymeric thin films. In fact, multiple characterization in different conditions was possible. The results reported in terms of morphological information, thickness distribution, three-dimensional (3D) mapping, large field of view, high magnification, and super resolution of the zoomed area offer a good solution for testing materials and obtaining a quantitative characterization and whole inspection in the case of complex polymeric samples.  © 2023 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).},

	abstract = {With the continuous improvement of the requirements for parts of national defense core equipment, castings are developing in the direction of complex structures, such as large wall thickness differences and multi-cross structures, which make it more difficult to detect internal defects in castings. In the process of X-ray flaw detection, filming relies on manual adjustment of imaging parts and parameters. There are problems such as easy missed detection of flaw detection parts and large fluctuations in imaging quality. It is urgent to develop intelligent partition parameter adjustment filming technology. For this reason, this paper proposes a method for generating virtual flaw detection images for X-ray inspection of castings. Firstly, the casting coordinate dimension reduction mapping model is established, and the dimension reduction mapping of the casting three-dimensional coordinates to the two-dimensional coordinates of the imaging plate is realized. Secondly, the simulation imaging parameter fitting model is established, and the simulation flaw detection image of the standard three-dimensional model of the casting is generated by the point source virtual ray. Finally, a virtual imaging system for X-ray inspection of castings is developed by integrating the two models. This method can provide optimized imaging attitude and imaging parameter information for actual flaw detection, and provide theoretical support for intelligent partition parameter adjustment and filming technology. © 2024 Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society.

	abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) has emerged as an innovative technology that gives designers several advantages, such as geometric freedom of design and less waste. However, the quality of the parts produced is affected by different design and manufacturing parameters, such as the part orientation, the nozzle temperature and speed, the support material, and the layer thickness. In this context, the layer thickness is considered an important AM parameter affecting the part quality and accuracy. Thus, in this paper, a new adaptative slicing method based on the cusp vector and the surface deviation is proposed with the aim of minimizing the dimensional defects of FFF printed parts and investigate the impact on the dimensional part tolerancing. An algorithm is developed to automatically extract data from the STL file, select the build orientation, and detect intersection points between the initial slicing and the STL mesh. The innovation of this algorithm is exhibited via adapting the slicing according to the surface curvature based on two factors: the cusp vector and the surface deviation. The suggested slicing technique guarantees dimensional accuracy, especially for complex feature shapes that are challenging to achieve using a uniform slicing approach. Finally, a preview of the slicing is displayed, and the G-code is generated to be used by the FFF machine. The case study consists of the dimensional tolerance inspection of prototypes manufactured using the conventional and adaptive slicing processes. The proposed method’s effectiveness is investigated using RE and CMM processes. The method demonstrates its reliability through the observed potential for accuracy improvements exceeding 0.6% and cost savings of up to 4.3% in specific scenarios. This reliability is substantiated by comparing the resulting dimensional tolerances and manufacturing costs. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {When an electromagnetic sensor composed of a static excitation coil and a detection coil is moved in a steel tube at high speed, an eddy current is generated in the steel tube. If a defect is present in the steel tube, the defect may be detected by the change in the eddy current. Generally, the ferromagnetic heat transfer tubes in oil and chemical plants are inspected for defects by moving an internally inserted electromagnetic sensor at a high speed of about 1 m/s. Although there have been some past research reports for the detection of localized thinning in the steel tube, there are no reports for a wide range of thinning in the steel tube. Therefore, in this research, it is investigated a thickness measurement method for a wide range of thinning on the steel tube using only static magnetic field. As a result, it was shown that it is possible to measure the thickness in the steel tube by flux density inside the detection coil of the proposed static magnetic inspection sensor moving at 1m/s. The flux density in the steel tube is evaluated by the 3-D nonlinear FEM considering the velocity effect.  © 2023 IEEE.},

As a consequence, marine growth cleaning on offshore structures has been performed for many years. While the industry has shifted from diver-assisted to cleaning driven by remotely operated vehicles, the process remains costly and ineffective. This paper explores the possibilities for introducing an increased level of automation for marine growth inspection and classification. Specific attention is given to sensor technologies and methods for constructing a 3D representation of the offshore structures in order to assess the thickness and composition of marine growth. While optical-based methods show positive potential further work is needed to investigate the robustness to flicking sunlight and turbidity issues experienced in areas close to the water surface. The review of classification methods reveals several promising approaches where deep learning is applied for the categorization of marine growth. The training relies on large databases of relevant images which are not currently available for marine growth on offshore structures. Further work is needed for investigating if virtual images can be used in combination with a reduced set of real images.  © 2022 IEEE.},

Unfortunately, it may be computationally intensive for the simulation models. To improve the efficiency of the MAPoD, in this article, an efficient 3D eddy current nondestructive evaluation (ECNDE) forward solver is proposed to make estimations for PoD study. It is the first time that singular value decomposition (SVD) is used as the recompression technique to improve the overall performance of the adaptive cross approximation (ACA) algorithm-based boundary element method (BEM) ECNDE forward solver for implementation of PoD. Both the robustness and efficiency of the proposed solver are demonstrated and testified by comparing the predicted impedance variations of the coil with analytical, semi-analytical and experimental benchmarks. Calculation of PoD curves assisted by the proposed simulation model is performed on a finite thickness plate with a rectangular surface flaw. The features, which are the maximum impedance variations of the coil for various flaw lengths, are obtained entirely by the proposed model with selection of the liftoff distance as the uncertain parameter in a Gaussian distribution. The results show that the proposed ACA-SVD based BEM fast ECNDE forward solver is an excellent simulation model to make estimations for MAPoD study. © 2022 by the authors.},

In order to ensure structural integrity, regular inspection and cleaning procedures are carried out on the submerged structures, most commonly using remote-operated vehicles (ROVs). Often, the measurement methodology in these inspections is spot-checks using simple mechanical gauges, which yield a rough estimate of marine growth thickness. Expanding on this method, in order to optimize these inspection and cleaning procedures, modern methods for 3D surface measurement can be applied to increase inspection quality and ensure that superfluous cleaning is not carried out. This work investigates three state-of-the-art sensor technologies: a Time-of-Flight depth camera based on modulated visible blue laser illumination, a commercial stereo-vision solution based on visible-light sensors, and high-frequency imaging sonar. The sensors' performance has been compared in a laboratory environment to assess their suitability for use as a measurement device for marine-growth measurement in terms of accuracy, resolution, and noise/artifacts.

	abstract = {Background: The accuracy of digital implant transfer is currently under investigation in relation to the effect of saliva, scan body material, and exposed length. Methods: Six completely edentulous casts with four implant fixtures were fabricated. The four implant fixtures in each cast were placed below the crest of the ridge of the casts by 1.5 mm. The four implant fixtures were alternately attached to four implant scan bodies (PEEK) Group (I) and (TITANIUM) Group (II). For each cast, two flexible polyurethane layers with varying thicknesses were fabricated and molded on the six 3D printed identical casts after the placement of the implant fixtures in each cast for the soft tissue moulage in the cast. The six casts were alternately covered with a 2 mm and 4 mm thick layer. The six reference casts were recorded using a coordinate measurement machine (CMM) and subsequently scanned with an Intraoral scanner (MEDIT I 700). The scanning was conducted under both dry and wet conditions, with artificial saliva applied. The scanning platform consisted of two transparent acrylic boxes, and the process followed standardized scanning conditions using a digital lux meter (n = 48). The mean difference and standard deviation values (± SD) between the implant scan bodies measured on the reference and experimental scans were calculated using the inspection software program (Medit design). Data were fed to the computer and analyzed using IBM SPSS software package version 20.0. (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Shapiro-Wilk test were used to verify the normality of distribution. Quantitative data mean and standard deviation. The significance of the obtained results was determined at the 5% level. The student t-test for normally distributed quantitative variables was used to compare the two groups studied. Results: Statistically significant differences in wettability condition discrepancies were found between groups (I) and (II) (p < 0.05). In addition, there were statistically significant differences in intraoral scan body (ISB) length between the two groups (p < 0.05). Regarding the intraoral scan body material, statistically significant differences were found between the two groups (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The presence of saliva significantly affects the accuracy of the digital implant transfer. Additionally, using a longer intraoral scan body improves the accuracy of digital implant impressions. The titanium scan body had a greater level of precision on the implant impression scan. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Objective Deep-space exploration is important to innovate space technology and explore space resources. A collimator is a key component of a deep-space probe; however, producing a high spatial resolution collimator is challenging. Currently, the deep-space exploration collimator grid is mostly composed of frames. Casting or laser additive manufacturing is used to build the inner grid structure, which is quite thick, as well as the entire outside wall. The grid frame is then used to create the microgrooves. Finally, the collimator grid is formed by inserting tungsten or tantalum foils into the microgrooves. Furthermore, collimator grid manufacturing technologies include LIGA and electrical discharge wire-cutting. These approaches may result in thick walls, limiting the collimator' s duty ratio and efficiency, or result in a longer manufacturing period, higher cost, and a smaller grid height. The hard X-ray modulation telescope satellite (HXMT), which China developed independently, is used as an example to present our research progress on laser microwelding technology and equipment development for the cross-scale collimator grid, which is funded by the National Key Research and Development Program. Methods The laser spot welding experiment was conducted first to identify the welding parameters based on the structural features of the HXMT collimator. The grid deformation finite element analysis was then performed to provide laser welding guidance. Finally, laser welding equipment was designed and validated to meet the grid cell laser welding requirements. Results and Discussions The HXMT collimator is composed of an aluminum alloy frame with many tantalum grid cells placed into it. Laser spot welding junction points formed by two orthogonal arrays of tantalum foils are used to create the grid cell. The fabrication of tantalum foils, grid cell assembly and welding, and grid cell insertion into the collimator frame are all part of the manufacturing process (Fig. 3). For laser welding grid cells, an IPG YLM-150/ 1500-QCW quasicontinuous fiber laser and a self-developed three-dimensional (3D) dynamic focusing galvanometer are employed. With a beam diameter of 40 ;im, laser power of 180-220 W, and pulse width of 6-10 ms, a well-formed welding spot is created (Fig. 4). The results of the finite element analysis show that instability deformation is common during the laser welding of the collimator grid cell (Fig. 5). To address this issue, an integrated set combining tantalum foil assembly and collimator grid welding/insertion is developed (Fig. 6). The assembly error and welding deformation are well-controlled, resulting in the collimating hole' s dimensions accuracy being within +20 fim. The self-designed laser microwelding equipment consists primarily of a quasicontinuous fiber laser, a self-developed 3D dynamic focusing galvanometer, an X/Y motion platform with a Z support frame and motion axis, a CCD vision inspection system, and a computer control system, among other components (Fig. 7). Before welding, the stage moves to the CCD field of view to locate the welding point; next, the stage moves to the galvanometer, which can quickly and accurately regulate the movement of the laser beam, allowing for the rapid and precise welding of each grid cell's welding spot. After welding, the stage returns to the CCD field of view to detect and evaluate welding quality (Fig. 8). Conclusions High-efficiency laser microwelding and detection of large depth and high spatial resolution collimator grid have been realized using linkage technology of online visual inspection, dynamic focusing galvanometer, and CNC machine as well as the development of an integrated set to combine tantalum foil assembly and collimator grid welding/insertion, as along with the development of laser microwelding equipment and welding process. The accuracy of collimating hole size can be controlled within +20 ;im for the tantalum collimator grid with 70 ;im wall thickness, 1.17 mm x 4.68 mm collimating hole size, and 67 mm depth. © 2022 Science Press.

	abstract = {The main cause of structural deficiency in steel bridges is corrosion damage at girder ends caused by the leakage of bridge joints. This localized corrosion damage reduces steel girders’ bearing strength and affects bridge structures’ overall load-carrying capacity. Accurate estimation of the residual strength of corroded elements is critical for prioritizing repair projects and allocating funding and resources. However, due to the varied environment around the metal surface, corrosion damage on bridge girders is highly variable in severity and shape. The inspection results could vary greatly from inspector to inspector using the current methods. The accuracy of the inspection cannot be ensured. To address this limitation, this study proposes a methodology for creating a computationally efficient finite element (FE) model of a steel plate girder end with the exact representation of the geometry of the corroded region using 3D scan data. The point cloud data from a high-resolution structured-light 3D scanner is used to obtain geometric features such as plate boundaries, connectivity between plates, and thickness variations across plates. This information is used to automatically create a FE model of the damaged girder using shell elements. The applicability and accuracy of the proposed methodology were evaluated using the results from the load testing of a full-scale girder with corrosion damage. The agreement between the experimental and analytical failure mode, force–displacement relationship, and strain distribution on the plates demonstrated the accuracy of the method for estimating the residual bearing strength of plate girders with corrosion damage. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Structural timber is one of the commonly used construction materials. Timber can contain natural internal defect such as knot or natural decay due to its anatomical complexity. Moreover, internal damages or stiffness reductions can also be induced by environmental and biological factors such as weathering and termite attacks. This hidden internal damage increases the difficulty of damage detection using conventional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods. Ultrasonic guided wave (GW) damage detection technique is one of the promising damage detection techniques, which can be employed to achieve an effective and robust damage inspection in timber. However, limited attention has been paid to the use of GW for damage detection in timber, due to the material anisotropy and inhomogeneity. This paper assesses the capability of GW in detecting different sizes of the internal damages in a structural red oak timber using the fundamental anti-symmetric mode (A0) of GW. Measured GW signals in forward and backward scattering directions are used to calculate the reflection and transmission ratios for different sizes of internal damages. A series of comprehensive experimental and numerical parametric studies are carried out using three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) simulations. Good agreement is obtained between numerical and experimental results. The experimentally verified FE model is utilized to further investigate the wave reflection and transmission phenomena from different characteristics of internal damages, such as different lengths, widths, thicknesses, and through thickness locations. The outcomes of this study demonstrate the robustness of GW technique in detecting conspicuous internal damages in structural timber. It demonstrates the feasibility of quantitative assessments of internal damages in timber using A0 GW. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In new high definition lighting modules, assembling more than thousand elements (pixels) with a single mm-sized motherboard is achieved by reflow soldering. Lead-free solders may constitute a weak part of electronic components and LED assemblies. During reflow, the distance between pixels and motherboard controls the solder heights (10 μm). After assembly, all the pixels are in a single plane. To ensure constant solder heights, this plane has to be parallel to the motherboard. A small disorientation during reflow may lead to severe solder damage prior to any use of the opto-electronic component. Present work presents a novel non-destructive method for characterizing any chosen solder in the assembled component without unpacking the latter. A femtosecond motorized laser source is used for digging a hole in the LED above the selected solder. Then a Focused Ion Beam facility allows to mill around this specific solder. The same FIB facility allows making several hundred slices of controlled thickness and orientation in the solder material. During this slicing operation, high-resolution inspection is done by FEG-SEM (Field Emission Gun - Scanning Electron Microscope) imaging. 3D tomographic reconstruction of the solder is obtained by classical commercial software AVIZO. Finally, 3D damage in solder material is illustrated by example results. © 2022},

	abstract = {Inspecting damage through visual inspection is an outdated and inefficient method, especially for large concrete dam structures. Furthermore, inspecting for damage to dam structures is costly, time-consuming, and hazardous. This research proposes a novel method for detecting and measuring cracks in the concrete structure of dams by utilizing a combination of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) algorithm and image-based 3D modeling. The method enables the identification of cracks on large structures at a pixel level, facilitating detection over a wide area and with high accuracy. Specifically, the approach detects cracks on the three-dimensional surface of the dam, providing a comprehensive and effective means of identifying potential structural issues. To accurately determine the size of the detected damage, the local thickness (LT) algorithm is introduced. This algorithm utilizes the pixel-precise detection capabilities of crack detection to provide highly precise crack size measurements. The CNN-FCN system segments cracks at the pixel level on the texture space obtained from a 3D model created through photogrammetry techniques. Then the trained CNN is employed to detect crack patches, which are then imported into a trained FCN system for pixel-level segmentation. The predicted crack pixels are converted to a physical scale by the LT algorithm to quantitatively measure the morphological features of cracks. The resulting crack map is then projected onto a 3D model, providing a comprehensive visual representation of the cracks. The proposed crack detection method can achieve an accuracy of over 90%. The study revealed that the presented system could efficiently and precisely detect, locate, and measure the size of cracks in large dam structures, highlighting the potential of the proposed method to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of crack inspection. Furthermore, the visualization of cracks on 3D models can help increase inspectors' inspection efficiency. © 2023 by DEStech Publi cations, Inc. All rights reserved},

	abstract = {Pipelines are typically used to transport oil, natural gas, water, etc. It is one of the most effective methods for transferring fluids over long distances. However, long-term usage of these pipes without maintenance results in the formation of residues, which will pave the way for pipeline accidents and soil contamination. To ensure the safety and protection of resources, these sustainable pipelines need to be inspected to avoid losses. This work aims to investigate various internal defect leaks in the non-uniform thickness of sustainable water pipes that are joined with a pipe expander. The magnetic flux leakage technique was implemented to evaluate these defects by means of a flexible GMR sensor array. An inspection robot containing two units was fabricated with the aid of 3D printing. The power unit provides the necessary thrust to actuate the entire robot whereas the sensing unit is responsible for analyzing the leaks. The robot’s movement is predicted by the MPU6050 and ultrasonic distance sensors that are plotted as motion plots. The sensing unit consists of permanent magnets and a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) array to interrogate the flux leakage in the defect region. The flux leakage from the defects was stored with the help of an Arduino microcontroller, which controls the overall process. In addition, the spring suspension is provided to regulate the motion of the robot. The flux leakage from the defect region was plotted as waveform graphs. Thus, the results are effectively presented and compared. The calculated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the magnetic flux leakages (MFLs) for 4.5 mm-thick pipe defects was 12 to 20.8 dB, and for 6.52 mm-thick pipe defects, it was 9.5 to 19 dB. In sum, the MFL technique provides a reliable method for the sustainable development of water supply to wide areas. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) plays an important role in ophthalmology and automatic analysis of the OCT is of real importance: image denoising facilitates a better diagnosis and image segmentation and classification are undeniably critical in treatment evaluation. Synthetic OCT was recently considered to provide a benchmark for quantitative comparison of automatic algorithms and to be utilized in the training stage of novel solutions based on deep learning. Due to complicated data structure in retinal OCTs, a limited number of delineated OCT datasets are already available in presence of abnormalities; furthermore, the intrinsic three-dimensional (3D) structure of OCT is ignored in many public 2D datasets. We propose a new synthetic method, applicable to 3D data and feasible in presence of abnormalities like diabetic macular edema (DME). In this method, a limited number of OCT data is used during the training step and the Active Shape Model is used to produce synthetic OCTs plus delineation of retinal boundaries and location of abnormalities. Statistical comparison of thickness maps showed that synthetic dataset can be used as a statistically acceptable representative of the original dataset (p > 0.05). Visual inspection of the synthesized vessels was also promising. Regarding the texture features of the synthesized datasets, Q-Q plots were used, and even in cases that the points have slightly digressed from the straight line, the p-values of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test rejected the null hypothesis and showed the same distribution in texture features of the real and the synthetic data. The proposed algorithm provides a unique benchmark for comparison of OCT enhancement methods and a tailored augmentation method to overcome the limited number of OCTs in deep learning algorithms.

	abstract = {The use of additive technologies in the creation of soldering masks opens up new opportunities in the production of printed circuit boards, in particular, the use of soldering masks for boards with integrated components. The paper considers the results of experimental data on the adhesion of 3D soldering masks (that is, masks created on a 3D printer) obtained during the study of the introduction of 3D printing into electronic manufacturing processes. For the analysis of adhesion, it is possible to use such methods as breaking load, cross-cut test, and the sticky tape method. A number of experiments were conducted to study the adhesion by testing the breaking load. The samples were formed with different ratios of prepreg/solder mask, then the force at which the fracture occurred was measured. The essence of the cross-cut test is to apply at least three parallel cuts and perpendicular to them also at least three parallel cuts with the tip of the cutter. After the scratching, there must be no flaking of the coating between the lines and in the grid of squares, then the results are assessed. Sticky tape tests are performed by applying the tape with the adhesive side to the test sample with a cured coating applied. The results are assessed by visual inspection using an optical device that provides 3x magnification. The results of the breaking load experiments indicate that 3D masks show comparable separation forces with a prepreg. At the same time, the force is stable for all types of surfaces and practically does not depend on the thickness and configuration of the 3D mask. Experiments with applying cross-cuts show consistently good results with a homogeneous base material - there are no coating detachments. The paper concludes that the use of 3D soldering masks on the inner layers of multilayer printed circuit boards with built-in components is possible, but a number of issues must be solved for this, including those related to the software for forming 3D structures of masks. © 2021 The Author.

	abstract = {Eutectic bonding is the primary method of integrated packaging for achieving efficient heat dissipation in power chips. However, for specialized power chips for wire-free packages with hot-via interconnections between upper layer and the backside pads on the lower layer, achieving high-precision, zero-damage, and highly reliable eutectic bonding is challenging using conventional equipment and methods. This paper proposes a simple and efficient approach that employs a specially designed Si-based fixture and thermocompression bonding process to achieve eutectic bonding of such kind of power chips. The fixture is fabricated using MEMS technology and comprises two layers: a structural layer and a thermal barrier layer. The structural layer features numerous micro-cavities that enable effective avoidance of air bridges when power chips are placed face-down. The thermal barrier layer assists in controlling the temperature of the solder layer during back-end co-soldering, thereby enhancing the reliability of the solder joint. Finite element simulations were carried out to analyze the heat transfer path during the eutectic process. The results indicate that when the thickness of the barrier layer is 200 micrometers, the temperature of the bonding tool reaches 300, while the temperature of the solder layer reaches 280. Finally, we fabricated samples and conducted X-ray inspection, which showed satisfactory results in terms of alignment accuracy and soldering quality. This provides a feasible solution for high-precision and high-quality automated eutectic bonding of power chips in wire-free 3D stacking packages. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Endometrial thickness (EMT) and blood flow are commonly used indicators of endometrial receptivity. However, the results of single ultrasound examination studies differ. Therefore, we used 3-dimensional (3D) ultrasound to study the influence of changes in EMT, endometrial volume, and endometrial blood flow on frozen embryo transfer cycles. Methods: This was a prospective cross-sectional study. Women who underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF) at Dalian Women and Children’s Medical Group and met the inclusion criteria were enrolled between September 2020 and July 2021. Ultrasound examinations were performed in patients who underwent frozen embryo transfer cycles on the day of progesterone administration, the third day after progesterone administration, and the day of embryo transplantation. Two-dimensional ultrasound was used to record EMT, 3D ultrasound was used to record endometrial volume, and 3D power Doppler ultrasound imaging was used to record the following endometrial blood flow parameters: vascular index, flow index, and vascular flow index. Changes in the 3 inspections of the EMT, volume, vascular index, flow index, and vascular flow index and 2 inspections of estrogen levels were categorized as “declining” or “nondeclining”. The relationship between changes in a certain indicator and the IVF outcome was analyzed by univariate analysis and multifactorial stepwise logistic regression. Results: In total, 133 patients were enrolled in this study, 48 were excluded, and 85 were included in the statistical analysis. Among these 85 patients, 61 were pregnant (71%), 47 had a clinical pregnancy (55%), and 39 had an ongoing pregnancy (45%). The results showed that if the first change in endometrial volume was nondeclining, the outcomes of clinical and ongoing pregnancies were more likely to be unfavorable (P=0.03, P=0.01). Additionally, if the second change in endometrial volume on the day of embryo transplantation was nondeclining, the outcome of an ongoing pregnancy was more likely to be favorable (P=0.03). Conclusions: The changes in endometrial volume was a factor helpful in predicting the IVF outcome, whereas the changes in EMT and endometrial blood flow analyses were not helpful in predicting IVF outcome. © 2023 AME Publishing Company.

The current inspection covers the investigation of trihybrid nanoparticles mixed in the cross-fluid model part of a rotating stretched surface in the presence of a heat source/sink, radiation effect, and nonlinear/linear convection. A trihybrid fluid is a unique type of fluid that surpasses hybrid nanofluids, conventional fluids, and nanofluids. Moreover, acetone and engine oil interchange energy in comparison to other liquids. Trihybrid fluids are now widely used in facilities such as electrical chillers, biotechnology, power pumps, the automotive industry, and air cleaners. The flow presenting model equations are derived in a rotating frame to study the momentum and thermal transportation in a nanofluid. The modeled problem was simplified by considering the boundary layer principle, which resulted in the formation of complex coupled partial differential equations (PDEs). The derived PDEs were converted into the corresponding nonlinear ODEs using suitable similarity transformations. Then, the converted ordinary differential equations (ODEs) were solved numerically via a strong and authentic procedure called finite element procedure from the current inspection; it is recoded that finite element method is a powerful method to handle complex problems arising in modeling of several mechanisms. © 2023 De Gruyter.

	abstract = {Objective Terahertz (THz) waveguides are essential functional devices for the long-distance propagation and interconnection of THz waves; thus, they play an increasingly important role in THz applications, i.e., in wireless communications, medical imaging, and security inspections. To achieve high transmission efficiency and integration, various THz waveguides using different guiding mechanisms have been developed, including dielectric, photonic crystal, anti-resonance, and surface plasmonic waveguides. Recently, graphene-based hybrid plasmonic THz waveguides have attracted significant attention because of their tunable and flexible transmission. However, the inherent optical properties of two-dimensional graphene, such as the low absorption of incident waves and weak electromagnetic response, pose challenges in the design of high-performance waveguides. Emerging three-dimensional Dirac semimetals (3D DSMs) have high carrier mobilities and tunable energy band characteristics comparable to those of graphene, while overcoming the above-mentioned inherent shortcomings of graphene. In this study, we propose a tunable broadband hybrid plasmonic THz waveguide based on a 3D DSM dielectric ridge structure. The transmission characteristics are systematically simulated using the finite element method, and the effects of the structural parameters and Fermi energy of the DSM are analyzed. Methods A THz waveguide structure is designed in this study based on a 3D DSM hybrid plasmonic mechanism, which comprises a DSM layer, SiO2 layer, and Si layer from top to bottom (Fig. 1). The corresponding thicknesses are optimized to be 4, 2, and 10 μm, respectively. First, the complex permittivity of the 3D DSM at different Fermi levels in the THz regime is calculated based on the Kubo formula and two-band model (Fig. 2). Finite element method-based simulations are performed to reveal the quantitative influences of the structural geometric parameters and DSM Fermi energy on the THz transmission characteristics, including the real part of the effective mode index, normalized mode area, propagation length, figure of merit, and propagation mode. Results and Discussions The simulated results show that the effective mode refractive index decreases and the normalized mode area increases with increasing dielectric gap height. Owing to the enhanced low-loss dielectric mode characteristics, the propagation length and figure of merit (FOM) increase with the gap height, and the 3D DSM plasmonic properties weaken as the frequency increases (Fig. 3). It can be observed from the mode-field diagram that the loss of the waveguide gradually decreases as the gap height increases, and most of the modes in the waveguide can be restricted from propagating at the tip of the rhombic Si region (Fig. 4). As the size of the rhombic Si medium increases, more modes propagate into the high-refractive-index Si medium, and the role of the dielectric mode increases. As the mixed mode confined by the 3D DSM layer is weakened, the effective mode refractive index and mode area increase, and the dielectric mode gradually becomes dominant in the mixed mode, causing an increase in the propagation length (Fig. 5). Finally, the influence of the Fermi level on the propagation characteristics is analyzed. As the Fermi level changes from 0.01 eV to 0.1 eV, the propagation length of the waveguide can be greatly tuned from 3.33×102 μm to 1.72×104 μm with the maximum modulation depth of the propagation length up to 98.06%, and a modulation depth of more than 90% in the broad frequency range of 0.5‒2.0 THz can be achieved (Fig. 7). Conclusions A tunable broadband THz waveguide based on a 3D DSM is demonstrated through numerical simulations. The transmission characteristics in response to the dielectric gap height, medium size, and Fermi level of 3D DSM are investigated. The simulated results show that as the gap height increases, the real parts of the effective mode refractive index, normalized mode area, and propagation length increase. The side length of the rhombus medium also has a certain impact on the propagation characteristics. Specifically, the real parts of the effective mode refractive index, mode area, and propagation length increase with the side length of the rhombus medium. The Fermi level has a significant effect on the propagation characteristics. As the Fermi level of the 3D DSM increases, the real part of the effective mode refractive index decreases, whereas the mode area and propagation length increase. As the Fermi level increases from 0.01 eV to 0.10 eV, the propagation length of the waveguide increases from 3.33×102 μm to 1.72× 104 μm, and the modulation depth of the propagation length exceeds 90% in the broadband working frequency of 0.5‒2.0 THz. These findings provide an important reference for understanding the propagation mechanism of 3D DSM hybrid plasmonic waveguides, hence they are good candidates for various applications in tunable and broadband THz waveguides and modulators. © 2024 Science Press.

	abstract = {Multi-slice imaging can obtain the Three-dimensional(3D) information of thick objects by modeling specimen as a number of slices. This approach can be applied to biomedical imaging, integrated circuit inspection and sample thickness measurement. Multi-slice ptychography is a full-field and lensless imaging method exploiting 3D Ptychographic Iterative Engine (3PIE) algorithm to reconstruct the complex-value function of object planes and illumination beams simultaneously. Even though this method does not require prior knowledge, inaccurate initial guesses of the object planes lead to more iterations than for a single-slice object. Compressive holography (CH) is another method for reconstructing multi-slice objects. It enables to obtain 3D information from a single 2D Gabor hologram by compressive sensing (CS) algorithm. In this paper, both methods are combined and the corresponding algorithm is proposed, in which the reconstructed multi-slice object by CH is adopted as the initial guess for object planes in 3PIE providing a more accurate initial value. Experimentally, the ptychography data set and a single in-line hologram are recorded in sequence. The numerical simulation studies on double-slice and three-slice objects were conducted, respectively. Numerical simulation results indicate that our method has a smaller error compared to traditional methods and it can improve the convergence speed. The proposed method was experimentally demonstrated using a double-slice object. The conclusions drawn from the experiments are in agreement with the simulations.

	abstract = {Fabricating complex parts using additive manufacturing is becoming more popular in diverse engineering sectors. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) methods can be implemented to reduce inspection costs and ensure structural integrity and safety in these parts. In this study, the Surface Response to Excitation (SuRE) method was used to investigate the wave propagation characteristics and load sensing capability in conventionally and additively manufactured ABS parts. For the first set of the test specimens, one conventionally manufactured and three additively manufactured rectangular bar-shaped specimens were prepared. Moreover, four additional parts were also additively manufactured with 30% and 60% infill ratios and 1 mm and 2 mm top surface thicknesses. The external geometry of all parts was the same. Ultrasonic surface waves were generated using three different signals via a piezoelectric actuator bonded to one end of the part. At the other end of each part, a piezoelectric disk was bonded to monitor the response to excitation. It was found that hollow sections inside the 3D printed part slowed down the wave travel. The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) were implemented for converting the recorded sensory data into time–frequency images. These image datasets were fed into a convolutional neural network for the estimation of the compressive loading when the load was applied at the center of specimens at five different levels (0 N, 50 N, 100 N, 150 N, and 200 N). The results showed that the classification accuracy was improved when the CWT scalograms were used. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To determine the impact of build orientation, increased layer thickness, and dental crowding on the trueness of three-dimensional (3D)–printed models, and to evaluate how these parameters affect the fit of thermoformed appliances. Materials and Methods: Ninety-six dental models were printed horizontally and vertically on the building platform using different 3D-printing technologies: (1) a stereolithography (SLA) printer with layer thicknesses of 160 lm and 300 lm and (2) a digital light processing (DLP) printer with layer thicknesses of 100 lm and 200 lm. Each printed model was digitalized and superimposed on the corresponding source file using 3D rendering software, and deviations were quantified by the root mean square values. Subsequently, a total of 32 thermoformed appliances were fabricated on top of the most accurate 3D-printed models, and their fit was evaluated by digital superimposition and inspection by three blinded orthodontists. Paired t-tests were used to analyze the data. Results: Significant differences (P, .05) between printing technologies used were identified for models printed horizontally, with the SLA system achieving better trueness, especially in crowded dentitions. No significant differences between technology were found when models were printed vertically. The highest values of deviation were recorded in appliances fabricated on top of DLP-printed models. The results of the qualitative evaluation indicated that appliances fabricated on top of SLA models outperformed the DLP-modeled appliances. Conclusions: Three-dimensional printing with increased layer height seems to produce accurate working models for orthodontic applications. © 2024 by The EH Angle Education and Research Foundation, Inc.},

	abstract = {Due to the significance and complexity of rail surface quality inspections on production lines, manual completion is inefficient. Existing 3D vision techniques, such as stereo vision, are too complex and cumbersome for industrial use. This paper introduces a straightforward and fast line laser calibration method, along with a rail surface defect detection approach using line laser 3D reconstruction. By projecting line lasers onto the sides of a calibration board of specific thickness, the position of the laser centerlines in the side areas is extracted to ascertain the world coordinates of the corresponding point clouds. Four sets of line laser measurement devices are then employed to conduct a full coverage scan of the rail. A streamlined multi-camera joint calibration method is presented, which stitches together 3D point clouds from various perspectives to recreate the complete cross-sectional profile of the rail. After transforming into a surface depth variation map, defects are identified based on depth thresholds. The method not only precisely locates and categorizes defects but also reduces reconstruction errors by 0.1mm and simplifies the calibration process by eliminating the need for multiple rotations of calibration targets, thereby speeding up and enhancing the feasibility of industrial application. The approach overcomes the complexities and cumbersome processes associated with traditional methods not suited for industrial settings. The system can detect at a speed of 1.5m/s, identifying surface defects deeper than 0.3mm with a verified accuracy of less than 0.02mm, thus fulfilling the requirements for rail surface defect inspection.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Matching infrared thermography (IRT) with deep learning-based computer vision has recently gained a lot of interest for automated defect assessment in materials. One of the remaining bottlenecks concerns the necessity of a large and diverse experimental and/or virtual training dataset in order to achieve a sufficiently generalizable computer vision algorithm. This paper presents a parametrized 3D finite element (FE) framework, implemented in Fortran90, for efficiently simulating optical infrared thermographic inspection of multi-layer anisotropic media and establishing large-scale virtual dataset with sufficient diversity. The interface element is introduced for the modelling of an imperfect thermal contact, allowing to simulate a variety of defect types. The flexibility of the interface element makes it possible to simulate delaminations with different thickness using the same discretized model. Validation is done for two benchmark cases which are representative for a fiber reinforced polymer laminate with delamination-like defects. In order to achieve true-to-nature thermographic simulation data, non-uniform heating conditions are adopted from experiment, and a stochastic morphology generator is introduced for modelling realistic irregular defect geometries. To demonstrate the added value of a large, diverse and true-to-nature virtual database for computer vision applications, a Faster-RCNN model was trained on a generated virtual dataset for the detection of delamination-like defects in fiber reinforced polymer laminates. Application of the trained Faster-RCNN on experimental thermographic data yields excellent inference results, illustrating the high generalization ability of the virtually trained object detector. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) parts retain a certain degree of individuality and could suffer from a combination of different defect types, and therefore the nondestructive evaluation on AM parts remains a challenging task. Engineering non-contact and nondestructive real-time inspection and in situ quality assurance of AM parts would be a net improvement compared to current quality control methods that are conducted post-production. Here, the authors propose to combine the use of a laser vibrometer with a compression-driven shock tube to assess the quality of AM parts through the evaluation of the vibration spectra of the part. An AM of a cylindrical part was selected for the study, along with different defect types and sizes. These defects include internal voids of different sizes at different locations, local changes in thickness (infill), and local changes in melting temperatures. A numerical model was created and validated using experimental data to conduct model-assisted probability of detection (MAPOD). Results were analyzed by evaluating correlation matrices between different models. Results showed that vibration spectra induced by a shock wave were sensitive to different types and sizes of defects under the studied geometry. The defect index yielded an approximately linear relationship with respect to defect void severity. MAPOD curve studies revealed a minimum detectable void defect of 0.039% of the AM part's volume.

The contours are compared to thickness measurements obtained by ultrasonic thickness gauge, and the results validate the efficiency of 3D scanning as a potential technology for bridge inspections. Then, in a second phase, experimental testing of a corroded girder is performed to obtain the capacity and the mode of failure. Finally, in the last part of the paper, the 3D scanning data are combined through an automated procedure with finite element analysis and analytical provisions to examine whether 3D scanning can inform these two tools reasonably for accurate capacity predictions.

	abstract = {Background: In this randomized controlled trial, we assessed the neuroprotective effect of a 12-week resistance training (RT) program on executive control and cortical thickness of the prefrontal, temporal, parietal, and central cortex, regions prone to structural decline in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: Seventy older adults (aged 60–85 y old, 38 females and 32 males) were randomly allocated to a 12-week lower limb RT program or a waiting list control group. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to stratify participants screened for high (< 26) or low (≥ 26) MCI risk. Cognitive measurements consisted of the two-choice reaction time, Go/No-go, mathematical processing, and memory search tests. Cortical thickness was estimated from 3D T1-weighted MR images. Results: Complete randomized controlled trial data was obtained from 50 individuals (24 with high MCI risk). Significant Group x Time interactions were found for response on the Go/No-go task and cortical thickness of the right parahippocampal gyrus [F ≥ 5.3, p ≤ 0.03; η2p ≥ 0.12]. An inspection of these observations revealed an increase in cortical thickness (+1.18 %) and a decrease in response time (-4.35 %) in individuals with high MCI risk allocated to the exercise group (both uncorrected p = 0.08). Decreased response time on the Go/No-go task was associated with increased cortical thickness in the right entorhinal gyrus (uncorrected p = 0.01). Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that 12 weeks of RT intervention may effectively improve cognitive performance and slow neuronal loss in the hippocampal complex of older adults at high MCI risk. Findings support evidence for the neuroprotective effects of resistance training and its potential role in cognitive health. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {Objective: Ternary blades are used in the impellers of aerospace turbojet engines, large-scale marine gas turbines, and automotive advanced turbine engines. The joints connecting the ternary blades to the impeller base are irregularly shaped surfaces. The ternary blade has special, complex, and spatial structure with a large inclination angle, large distortion, and other characteristics that conform to the ternary flow design theory; this design reduces energy loss when fluid travels through the impeller and improves its efficiency. Thus, ternary blade manufacturing has received considerable attention, and its unique structure imposes severe processing requirements. However, ternary blades are mainly processed by Computerized Numerical Control Electrical Discharge Machining (CNC EDM) and CNC milling; the number of materials eliminated during the processing is enormous, and the processing cycle is extensive. Laser additive manufacturing, a revolutionary type of forming technique, was proposed in the 1990s, which is used for efficient and moldless manufacturing of complicated structural elements. The research on laser additive manufacturing of ternary blades has significant practical applications. Currently, most multi-twisted blade formation, both home and abroad, is performed on a flat or cylindrical generatrix, and there are few reports on laser powder feeding additive manufacturing ternary blades on special-shaped base surfaces. The technique of streamline layering is proposed in this study, and the cladding formation of the ternary blade is effectively accomplished; this is based on the optical inner powder feeding cladding nozzle produced independently in the laboratory. Methods: The three-element blades described in this study are curved in the flow direction and are three-dimensionally twisted, with complex twisting and tilting characteristics. The blade stacking substrate is a concave curved surface rather than a standard horizontal substrate. However, it is challenging to obtain information on each unit's location and direction. The bottom of the three-element blade is an arc main base surface on the special-shaped base surface. Thus, this study proposes the following streamlined layering methods: first, the primary base surface is divided evenly in the radial direction to obtain circular arc slices perpendicular to the radial direction; second, the arc slices are divided equidistantly along the scanning direction to obtain the division unit; lastly, the vector formed by the centerline of the upper and lower planes of the division unit is used to determine the height and deflection direction. Further, when stacking, the nozzle's axis aligns with the dividing unit's direction; the cladding nozzle moves according to the division unit's position and direction, and the final splicing obtains the formed part of the ternary blade. Results and Discussions: To obtain segmentation units with varied structural characteristics, the streamline layering technique is developed for stacking the ternary blade's forming parts [Fig. 4(f)]. The homogeneous transformation matrix of each segmentation unit relative to the base coordinate system is determined through translation and rotation calculation, thus, determining the positional and directional information of each segmentation unit [Fig. 5(c)]. Further, the laser cladding nozzle in this study is an optical internal powder-feeding nozzle, which is independently developed in the laboratory; the cladding nozzle is installed on a six-axis robotic arm. During cladding, the axis of the cladding nozzle aligns with the dividing unit's direction and fits along the curve. The single-layer arc slice cladding is completed by splicing the trajectory of each segmentation unit, and the multilayer arc slice overlaps to generate the ternary blade laser cladding, forming a portion with an enormous inclination, complex bending, and torsion structure (Fig. 7). Conclusions: The streamline layering technique is proposed in this study to tackle the ternary blade laser cladding formation trajectory problem. The main base surface is evenly spaced along the radial direction to obtain arc slices perpendicular to the radial direction, which are then evenly spaced along the scanning direction to obtain the segmentation unit. The streamlined layering technique is proposed in this study to solve the problem of ternary blade structural parts layering, bending, and inclination, and to accomplish the accumulation of ternary blade forming parts. The inspection results of the formed parts are as follows: the surface of the ternary blade-formed parts is smooth, and the average surface roughness value is less than 4.065 μm, which effectively reduces the step effect; it achieves a good metallurgical combination with the irregular base surface, and the average thickness of the formed parts is 5.97 mm. The relative errors of thickness and torsion angle are from -1.4% to 1.03% and -4.67%, respectively. The forming accuracy is high. The heat accumulation at the laser molten pool is evident as the height of the formed part increases. Further, the microhardness reduces as the microstructure increases; the microhardness of the formed part ranges from 348.3 to 360.4 HV, and the metallographic structure is uniformly dense with no evident holes or cracks. © 2022, Chinese Lasers Press.

	abstract = {Microneedle arrays (µNA) are gaining popularity in the field of drug delivery due to their potential to minimize side effects compared to conventional hypodermic needles. Generally, µNA is manufacturing through three or two stages which lack of flexibility in design. 3d printing is one of the powerful method that could be employed in three or two stages. However, it could be extended to single stage by directly manufacturing µNA from designated material. Digital light processing (DLP) is a kind of 3d printing which is using in this study. A further understanding of DLP printing parameters would be investigated such as LED current (mA), curing time (sec), z-thickness (µm), and grayscale level image (0 to 255). This study explores the integration of DLP technology and machine learning (ML), namely DLP-ML, to manufacture µNA with customizable size, rapid production process, and reduced material wastage. The initial process in developing ML model is preparing a dataset obtained from experimental approach. An orthogonal table is simplified the number of experiment. The orthogonal table is contained five factors and five levels, L25. The dataset is divided into input and output and substituted to ML system. In this approach, ML algorithms are employed to determine the optimal digital mask patterns and printing parameters for DLP-ML manufacturing. The study is employed various ML configurations in term of algorithm and number of hidden layer. Under different algorithm, the sort of larger to lower accuracy is arranged Bayesian regularization backpropagation (BR10), Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation (LM10), and scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation (SCG10), respectively. It also notices that the deviation of BR10 is proving that µNA is manufactured uniformly on a substrate. It is ultimately selecting Bayesian regularization backpropagation for its superior accuracy, exceeding 90%. For different number of hidden layer, the default value, 10, is also resulting highest accuracy among others. Then, BR10 could be concluded as the best ML configuration in this case. This algorithm empowers DLP-ML manufacturing to produce µNA arrays with various aspect ratio (AR), representing the ratio between the height and base diameter of µNA. The AR of 15 is highest that could be performed and the critical AR of µNA bending is found at 7 (700/100). By harnessing the synergy of DLP-ML technologies, this research presents a promising avenue for the advancement of drug delivery systems, offering enhanced precision, scalability, and therapeutic efficacy in medical applications. Finally, DLP-ML is successfully developed a rapid µNA manufacturing with different dimensions very accurately. © 2024 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Manual wheel size inspection faces problems such as limited accuracy, low efficiency, and poor consistency. Machine vision technology can improve measurement accuracy, efficiency and consistency through high-resolution cameras and advanced image processing algorithms. However, due to factors such as difficult railside deployment, limited camera field of view and occlusion, it becomes difficult to obtain whole wheel data, thus affecting wheel size measurements. To address this problem, this paper proposes an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm improved by sampling consistency and distance threshold decay based on the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. Then, by adding calibration blocks and combining this algorithm to complete the point cloud registration of the whole wheel. Finally, based on the whole wheel data, the point set of the base point rounding and the wheel profile is extracted to complete the calculation of parameters such as wheel diameter, rim height, and rim thickness. The experimental results show that the registration algorithm in this paper improves the quality of registration by 24.311% on average compared with the original one. The measurement errors of wheel diameter, rim height, and rim thickness are only 0.5844mm, 0.2437mm, and 0.5484mm, which account for 0.0640%,0.8660%, and 1.8124% of the dimensions, respectively, and satisfy the requirements of wheel detection accuracy for trains. © 2024 SPIE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The objective was to determine the accuracy of 3D-printed dental models subjected to different storage conditions using six different material and printer combinations. Materials and Methods: Three completely dentate models were designed using dental CAD software (3Shape Dental System). A horseshoe-shaped solid base with a posterior horizontal bar was used. The models were printed in a horizontal direction against the building platform without support. The models were printed using six printers with the corresponding recommended resin material: Carbon M2 (DPR10), HeyGears A2D4K (Model HP UV2.0), Stratasys J5 (MED610), Stratasys Origin One (DM200), Envision One (E-Model LightDLP), and Asiga Pro4K (VeriModel) with a standard layer thickness of 50 μm. All printed models underwent scanning using a laboratory scanner (Sirona inEOS X5) after printing. Subsequently, the models were randomly assigned into three groups of storage conditions, LT: cold environment (4 ± 1°C), HT: hot and dry environment (50 ± 2°C), and RT: room temperature (25 ± 2°C) serving as the control. Each group was kept under the designated condition and was scanned at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 weeks. The total number of models (N) was 72, with 6 printers producing 12 models per printer for 3 storage conditions, resulting in 4 models for each storage condition and each printer. The generated STL files were imported into a 3D inspection software for comparison with the original STL files. In-tolerance percentage, the deviation RMS, trueness, and precision were obtained and analyzed with least square mean linear regression using JMP Pro 15 to identify the significant effects (α = 0.05). Results: The in-tolerance percentage as-printed was significantly different among different printers. Significant dimension deviations were observed after the first week of storage at HT and with subsequent weeks of storage. RT and LT did not show significant dimensional changes. Models printed with Carbon M2 showed the highest in-tolerance percentages compared to the other printers. Conclusions: The model deviations were affected by storage conditions and the printer used, with high-temperature storage showed least stability compared to low and room temperatures. No significant difference was observed between low and room temperature storage conditions. The Carbon M2 printer showed the highest accuracy among all printers tested. The region had a significant effect on the deviation measured, with the abutment body showing the least deviation. Among the 3D printers evaluated, A2D4K by HeyGears and Carbon M2 printers demonstrated the highest accuracy in terms of both precision and trueness. © 2024 by the American College of Prosthodontists.},

	abstract = {To ensure the structure integrity of the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV), the main challenge is the embrittlement of beltline material. However, the stress is more complex for the regions of Closure Head Penetration (CHP). Feedback of leakage at the CHP has been found during in-service inspection. Although the detailed mechanical evaluation of the RPV head and the CHP has been carried out by many international institutions, there are limited studies to concern structure integrity of CHP tube. The systematic analysis of the influence of material strength matching, assemble stress, the Welding Residual (WR) stress and work pressure load on the fracture is also limited. In this paper, the systematic influence of these factors is analyzed, and the distribution characteristics of Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) and the crack propagation characteristics are studied. The 2D model and accurate 3D model are carried out using the finite element method. The results show that the WR stress on the outer surface of the CHP and the area adjacent to the weld is larger than the yield strength of the material. There is a gap between the RPV and the upper part of the CHP. The attenuation rate of the WR stress in the outlet direction of RPV is lower than that in the inlet direction, so cracks are more likely to occur in the out of direction. The influence of WR stress on the circumferential stress distribution and fracture parameters in the wall thickness direction of CHP is bigger than the influence of assemble load and design condition load. However, the overall stress of CHP is low. The SIF values along the crack front have an asymmetric distribution, and the SIF value is very small. As the fatigue crack propagation life is much longer than the assumed limit in the design lifetime, the risk of fracture and crack fatigue propagation caused by mechanical stress is low. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is one of the earliest developed 3D printing processes, which has the advantages of a clean processing environment, low overall manufacturing costs, and a variety of optional materials. However, it still has the disadvantages of low dimensional accuracy and poor surface quality of the molded workpiece. Therefore, how to solve this annoying problem has become an important research topic in the current industry-university-research fields. In this study, a square container with a bottom area of 48 mm×48 mm, a height of 30 mm, and a thin wall of 6 mm was used as the design object, and four controllable factors were adopted: layer thickness (A), nozzle temperature (B), printing speed (C), and forming path (D), combined with Grey-Taguchi’s experiments and calculations are carried out in order to achieve the purpose of optimizing the inner volume (IV) and inner diagonal length (IDL) of the square container (dual-objective quality characteristics). The experimental results show that within the selected printing parameter range, the optimized process parameter combination is layer thickness of 0.25 mm (A3), nozzle temperature of 190 °C (B1), printing speed of 50 mm/s (C3) and the molding direction of the annular surface (D2). Finally, use the GOM Inspect software (ATOS Q 3D scanner) and vernier caliper (VC) to compare the physical errors. According to the verification results, the errors of IV and IDL of the square container obtained by optimizing process parameters are 0.49% and 1.53%, and 3.76% and 6.33% respectively in GOM Inspect software and vernier caliper measurement. The results of this optimization process not only prove that the GOM Inspect software has a considerable degree of accuracy, but also can be used as a means to improve FDM multi-quality printing process optimization when combined with the Grey-Taguchi method. © 2024 Institute of Physics Publishing.

	abstract = {Ballistic penetration of machine guards is a topic of great significance for ensuring safety and avoiding projection of objects out of the working space of machines. Although standardized tests are performed according to EU Directive 2006/42/EC, they have some limitations because they are carried out using a given penetrator that perpendicularly impacts a given surface of about 500 × 500 mm. Nevertheless, the withstanding capacity of those guards depends on a lot of different design parameters and physical quantities that have not been fully investigated. This paper is focused on the study of the influence of the machine guard size on the withstanding capacity to ballistic penetration throughout theoretical models and experimental tests based on an innovative method involving the use of 3D optical scanners for inspection. The experimental analyses described in this work, compared to theoretical results, demonstrate that a maximum plastic deformation area can be defined, independently of the plate size, given the same material, thickness, and penetrator. This result allows to set proper new ranges for standardized tests, overcoming the limitation of using specific sample sizes. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {In order to solve the problem of the difference in the diagnostic effect of different sequences of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations for anterior and posterior cruciate ligament injuries, the author proposes an MRI rehabilitation method to relieve anterior cruciate ligament injury in dancers. This method retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 60 patients with knee anterior and posterior cruciate ligament injuries in our hospital, and all patients were diagnosed with knee anterior and posterior cruciate ligament injuries. All patients underwent MRI 3D sequence and 2D sequence examination successively to compare anatomical measurements. This study aimed at comparing the measurements of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) between the two examination sequences; comparing the diagnosis; comparing the grading and judgment of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament injuries of the knee joint between the two inspection sequences; and comparing the diagnostic coincidence rates of the two examination sequences in the complete tear of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments of the knee. Experimental results show that, in terms of PCL and ACL, the angle, thickness, and length of two-dimensional MRI examination were significantly different from those of MRI examination and anatomical measurement (P<0.05); for PCL and ACL, the angle, thickness, and length of 3D MRI were not significantly different from anatomical measurements (P>0.05). The diagnostic accuracy of 2D MRI was 83.33%, which was lower than 95.00% of 3D MRI (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the grading of anterior and posterior cruciate ligament injuries between the two examination sequences (P>0.05). The diagnostic coincidence rates of 3D MRI and 2D MRI for complete tear of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments were 95.55% and 80.00%, respectively (P<0.05). In conclusion, three-dimensional MRI examination can obtain higher diagnostic value for patients with knee joint anterior and posterior cruciate ligament injury.  © 2022 Pin Yang.},

The diffuse ultrasonic wave inspection benefits from information from multiple scattering processes, which is suitable for the quality assurance of complex structures. This study established a two-dimensional wave propagation model assuming the decoupling of the fiber volume into the fiber distribution matrix in the plane and the local fiber fraction along the thickness axis. The k-space pseudospectral method was applied to calculate the diffuse wave fields. The defect inspection process was studied numerically based on the Locadiff technique for additive-manufactured short-fiber reinforced composites. The stretching method provided the same average distance but a smaller relative deviation to the defect than the doublet method. The localization resolution improved significantly for the initial increment of the number of transmitters; limited improvement can be achieved further. Localization results fluctuated when the transmitter combination groups were distant from the defect. This method worked well with the isotropic and quasi-isotropic plates, while an oversimplification was found for the unidirectional fiber structure. Copyright © 2022 Peng, Xu, Sun, Zuo and Zhu.},

	abstract = {Sunflower seeds, recognized for their nutritional value and taste, are a well-loved snack. However, throughout their growth and storage, sunflower seeds can develop various defects that not only compromise their quality but also present potential health hazards. To address these issues and ensure adherence to safety standards, we investigate the use of THz spectroscopy and imaging techniques for nondestructive identification and classification of common defects in sunflower seeds. The study begins by analyzing spectroscopy features to identify defective seeds, particularly those affected by mildew. It establishes three qualitative discrimination models (support vector machine, random forest, and backpropagation neural networks), which achieve overall accuracies of 88.3%, 91.7%, and 95%, respectively. Furthermore, THz transmission imaging is employed as a quantitative method to visualize the internal structure of sunflower kernels and provide precise plumpness estimates. A noteworthy innovation is the analysis of time delays in reflected pulses at each pixel, enabling the extraction of valuable kernel thickness information. These data are then utilized to convert traditional two-dimensional scanning data into intricate three-dimensional (3D) images, facilitating direct measurements of both 3D plumpness and kernel weight. The findings have significant implications for improving the quality and safety of sunflower seeds and may extend to the assessment of other agricultural products, contributing to enhanced quality control in the food industry. © 2024 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)},

Although previous studies have focused on the detection of localized thinning in the steel tube, there are no reports on a wide range of thinning in the steel tube. Therefore, this study investigated a thickness measurement method for a wide range of thinning in the steel tube using only a static magnetic field. Consequently, the possibility of measuring the thickness in the steel tube based on the flux density inside the detection coil of the proposed static magnetic inspection sensor moving at 1 m/s was demonstrated. The flux density in the steel tube was evaluated by the 3-D nonlinear finite-element method (FEM) considering the velocity effect.  © 1965-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Thin-walled milled monolithic aluminum workpieces are common in the aerospace industry, because of their advantages such as favorable material properties, established design methods, good machinability, known performance and reliable inspection techniques. Machining-induced residual stresses (MIRS) and initial bulk residual stresses (IBRS) are known to be the key factor for causing distortion of those workpieces. In this study the effect of both types, the milling path strategy and the wall thickness on the distortion is analyzed. A developed 3D linear elastic finite element (FEM) model, considering both types of RS as input, and predicting the resulting part distortion, is extended by using the true milling path as well as all RS contained in the entire workpiece. The simulation outcome is validated by experiments and distortion minimization techniques are derived. The results show that the model predicts the distortion shape and level for different wall thicknesses and milling strategies with a high accuracy. The experiments indicated that the distortion of low IBRS parts with 3 mm wall-thickness could be minimized by 42% by only changing the milling path. The simulation highlighted, that for smaller wall thicknesses, the distortion minimization potential is even higher (e.g. 2 mm wall thickness: up to 69% distortion minimization). For high IBRS parts, milling the inverse form of the predicted shape on the backside of the workpiece represents an alternative, which led up to a reduction of the distortion by 77%. In general, three main categories for precontrol distortion techniques can be identified as the process parameters, the part topology and the process strategy. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Metal additive manufacturing (AM) promises functional flexibility in the production of engineering components, and great progress has been made with respect to part geometry and overall performance criteria. The fracture and fatigue behaviors of metals depend on the sample microstructure, an aspect of metal AM for which many challenges remain. Here, we report on progress with respect to the rolling contact fatigue (RCF) performance of metal AM bearing rollers. A set of rollers was created using laser powder bed fusion from 8620HC steel powder. The print parameters were first studied with respect to laser power, laser scan speed, laser spot size, and layer thickness. A set of tapered cylindrical rollers was then manufactured using build parameters that were selected based on material density, optical microscopy, ultrasound, and residual stress measurements. The rollers were then heat-treated while still on the build plate to relieve any residual stresses. The rollers were removed from the build plate, machined to the typical product geometry, case-hardened, carburized, and ground to a final surface finish. Finally, the rollers were integrated within railroad tapered roller bearings and tested in two ways. The accelerated life test subjected the rollers to high-stress RCF that generated significant spalling on both types of rollers. The simulated service life test was designed with RCF at levels typical of in-service bearings. At the conclusion of this test, equivalent to 250, 000 miles, the performance of the AM rollers was judged to be in line with rollers manufactured using traditional methods, and visual inspections showed no surface damage to any rollers. The results of this study provide a clear foundation for additional AM roller designs that can exploit the unique capabilities of the AM process.

	abstract = {7T MRI provides unprecedented resolution for examining human brain anatomy in vivo. For example, 7T MRI enables deep thickness measurement of laminar subdivisions in the right fusiform area. Existing laminar thickness measurement on 7T is labor intensive, and error prone since the visual inspection of the image is typically along one of the three orthogonal planes (axial, coronal, or sagittal view). To overcome this, we propose a new analytics tool that allows flexible quantification of cortical thickness on a 2D plane that is orthogonal to the cortical surface (beyond axial, coronal, and sagittal views) based on the 3D computational surface reconstruction. The proposed method further distinguishes high quality 2D planes and the low-quality ones by automatically inspecting the angles between the surface normals and slice direction. In our approach, we acquired a pair of 3T and 7T scans (same subject). We extracted the brain surfaces from the 3T scan using MaCRUISE and projected the surface to the 7T scan’s space. After computing the angles between the surface normals and axial direction vector, we found that 18.58% of surface points were angled at more than 80° with the axial direction vector and had 2D axial planes with visually distinguishable cortical layers. 15.12% of the surface points with normal vectors angled at 30° or lesser with the axial direction, had poor 2D axial slices for visual inspection of the cortical layers. This effort promises to dramatically extend the area of cortex that can be quantified with ultra-high resolution in-plane imaging methods. © 2022 SPIE},

	abstract = {Hyperboloid cooling towers are counted among the largest cast-in-place industrial structures. They are an essential element of cooling systems used in many power plants in service today. Their main structural component, a reinforced-concrete shell in the form of a one-sheet hyperboloid with bidirectional curvature continuity, makes them stand out against other towers and poses very high construction and service requirements. The safe service and adequate durability of the hyperboloid structure are guaranteed by the proper geometric parameters of the reinforced-concrete shell and monitoring of their condition over time. This article presents an original concept for employing terrestrial laser scanning to conduct an end-to-end assessment of the geometric condition of a hyperboloid cooling tower as required by industry standards. The novelty of the proposed solution lies in the use of measurements of the interior of the structure to determine the actual thickness of the hyperboloid shell, which is generally disregarded in geometric measurements of such objects. The proposal involves several strategies and procedures for a reliable verification of the structure’s verticality, the detection of signs of ovalisation of the shell, the estimation of the parameters of the structure’s theoretical model, and the analysis of the distribution of the thickness and geometric imperfections of the reinforced-concrete shell. The idea behind the method for determining the actual thickness of the shell (including its variation due to repairs and reinforcement operations), which is generally disregarded when measuring the geometry of such structures, is to estimate the distance between point clouds of the internal and external surfaces of the structure using the M3C2 algorithm principle. As a particularly dangerous geometric anomaly of hyperboloid cooling towers, shell ovalisation is detected with an innovative analysis of the bimodality of the frequency distribution of radial deviations in horizontal cross-sections. The concept of a complete assessment of the geometry of a hyperboloid cooling tower was devised and validated using three measurement series of a structure that has been continuously in service for fifty years. The results are consistent with data found in design and service documents. We identified a permanent tilt of the structure’s axis to the northeast and geometric imperfections of the hyperboloid shell from −0.125 m to +0.136 m. The results also demonstrated no advancing deformation of the hyperboloid shell over a two-year research period, which is vital for its further use. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {3-Dimension (3D) printers are increasingly being used in high-tech industrial applications technology, because they can produce sophisticated products by laminating materials with less time and cost compared to cutting processing, such as conventional machine tools. However, since the reliability evaluation criteria and method for laminated manufacturing products are not clear, accidents cannot be prevented when 3D printed laminates are used as structures and machined parts. In this paper, ultrasonic wave propagation characteristics were evaluated on the specimens manufactured by laminating acrylonitrile butadiene styrene resin materials with a stereo lithography apparatus 3D printer using the ultrasonic inspection method among non-destructive techniques. Specimens were laminated in units of 0.1 mm, and thicknesses of 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 mm were applied as variables. In addition, the ultrasonic characteristics according to laminating direction were analyzed by laminating diagonally and vertically, including laminating in the horizontal direction, and defect specimens were produced to check whether defects were read. It was found that the ultrasonic velocity of the horizontally laminated specimen having a thickness of less than 4 mm was slower than the ultrasonic reference velocity, and that the ultrasonic velocity was affected according to the laminated direction. In addition, by arranging the defect location of the specimen differently, it was determined whether the defect was detected, and whether it was possible to check the location. Based on the results of this study, it will be possible to broadly apply this technique to advanced industrial technologies through evaluation of the condition and reliability of laminated manufacturing products manufactured with 3D printers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korean Society for Precision Engineering.},

	abstract = {In the realm of additive manufacturing, the quality and mechanical performance of 3D-printed structures are heavily influenced by the parametric settings used during the printing process. Some of these conditions include layer thickness, printing speed, infill density, filling pattern, printing substance, and so on. This research investigates the effect of printing factors on the strength characteristics of 3D-printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) as well as polylactic acid (PLA) structures. The parameters considered for the proposed study include material type, infill direction, infill density, and infill pattern. These four conditions are optimized using the machine-learning algorithm to obtain maximum strength in the resulting structures. The breaking load, extension, tensile strain, and tensile strength are the strength factors determined by the experiments. Furthermore, a deep neural network integrated with a walrus optimization algorithm (DNN-WOA)-based hybrid machine learning method is used in the experimental data to discover the optimal parametric conditions for constructing the structures with maximum strength. Based on the findings, infill density is a significant component in increasing both the tensile strength and elastic modulus of printed samples. Line and triangular-type infill patterns exerted the range of tensile strength with 10–20 MPa of deviations. In terms of tensile strain, the line pattern produced significantly more tensile strain than the triangle pattern. The highest breaking stress is observed at a 45∘ raster angle, regardless of infill density. When compared to the strengths of ABS and PLA, the PLA with a triangle infill pattern outperformed the ABS structure printed with a line-type infill pattern. The optimum printing settings for a PLA structure with a line-type infill pattern are 0∘ and 25% for raster angle and infill density, respectively. This parameter resulted in enhanced strength performance, with 45.81MPa of tensile strength, 12.13% of tensile strain, 359.34kgf of breaking load, 7.21mm of extension, and 24.12 min of printing time. © 2025 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Based on the traditional additive manufacturing, four-dimensional (4D) printing technology combines structure and shape memory effect (SME), which provides an effective way for the evolution of three-dimensional (3D) printing structure in shape, property and function. However, most of the current researches focus on the influence of printing process parameters on the mechanical properties of parts, and the actuation performance of hybrid conductive polymers is poor. Herein, a method combining 3D printing and coating is proposed to fabricate the electrothermal-responsive three-layer structural flexible actuator of paper-based Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) composites and polylactic acid (PLA) using 4D printing. The paper-based flexible layer is used as the support layer, the PLA layer made by 3D printing on one side of the paper-based layer is used as the active deformation layer, the MWCNTs/PEDOT:PSS conductive layer coated on the other side of the paper-based layer is used as the electrical actuation layer. The 4D deformation principle of the electrothermal-responsive flexible actuator was analyzed. The influence of printing parameters on the deformation angle of the flexible actuator was analyzed by orthogonal experiment. The experimental results show that the optimal printing parameters are the printing thickness of 0.1 mm, the printing speed of 50 mm s−1, the filling rate of 58%, and the substrate temperature of 60 °C. Under the optimal parameters, the fabricated three-layer structural flexible actuator of paper-based PEDOT:PSS/MWCNTs composites and PLA achieves a larger bending angle of 472.54° under a driving voltage of 25 V. Therefore, the prepared flexible actuator has excellent actuation performance. Moreover, the fabricated flexible actuators are applied in the fields of the flexible hand and the flexible manipulator, which demonstrates the great potential of the flexible actuator in the fields of human-computer interaction and flexible robot. © 2025 IOP Publishing Ltd.

	abstract = {The usage areas of plastic gear are increasing day by day because they are light, durable, easy to manufacture, and economical. Beveloid gears can operate on intersecting or divergent axes as well as parallel axes. Another important feature is that they are suitable for backlash adjustments with cross-cone angles like (+/-). The aim of this project is to classify beveloid gear quality tables via high-accuracy quality controls for gears made of plastic material (external-external and/or external/internal) with the involute profile. Minimum deviations and distortions are allowed in the profile and lead to providing the contact ratio performance values in the gears determined by the designer. Quality classification is carried out using traditional measurement methods on the profile and leads to straight beveloid gear internal and external gear made of plastic material in a 3D printer. The quality classification of cylindrical, worm, and bevel gear types is subject to classifications included in norms such as AGMA, ISO, and DIN. Since the general quality classification for plastic gear is in the low group, the minimum acceptance criteria for quality classification are cumulative pitch, single pitch deviation, and tooth thickness fluctuations are measured to define quality classification. When the quality inspection was made, tooth thickness variability was considered by using in-house software for Beveloid gear profiles.

	abstract = {Among different manufacturing techniques available for composite aircraft structures, prepreg-based manual layup is widely used. During the fabrication process, the protective films of the prepregs or other materials used in the process could get inside as a foreign object between the layers. The present method of finding the inclusions during the prepreg layup is by visual inspection in the cleanroom. Carrying out visual inspection is challenging as the layup is usually carried out on large surfaces and reflective by nature. This paper proposes a 3D laser scanner-based approach for the detection of inclusion on flat and curved surfaces. Using the portable laser scanner, the surfaces of each layer are scanned and compared the resulting point clouds using with a reference layer data. Thicknesses between two surfaces are computed with Cloud to Cloud, Mesh to Cloud and Hausdorff distance to enhance the visibility of inclusions. It was found that this approach could enhance the visibility of inclusions over 50 micron and above. These enhanced features are used to train a multiview convolutional neural network to mark the inclusion regions, which can aid the inspector to identify the inclusion regions in a fast and efficient way. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Quality inspection of micro-holes is costly and redrilling defective holes can lead to imperfection owing to the misalignment in re-aligning the removed specimens. Thus this paper proposes an in-situ, automatic inspection method using photodiode data and machine learning models to detect defects in real-time during the fabrication of SK5 steel plates with 1064 nm Nd:YAG Laser machines to reduce the workload and increase the quality of products. Further, it explores the possibility of generalizing the models to 51 different scenarios of fabrication by classifying unseen data into 51 classes. A dataset of around 1,500,000 time series data points was generated using an optical probe while drilling over 56,000 holes into test specimens. 15 different combinations of thickness and diameter were drilled using suggested parameters. An additional 12 potential defect-prone conditions were designed to obtain data during conditional drilling. Hole quality was measured for each hole using OGP 3D profile microscope measuring machine. Results showed high accuracy in specialized defect detection within each scenario and showed a possibility of classifying photodiode data patterns, offering opportunities to improve the practicality of the proposed solution. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Previously it was used mostly for defects indication. However, modern devices and software allow an application of a quantitative estimation of parameters of the defects. This contribution presents a novel infrared thermographic method for quantitative defect depth estimation. The majority of known thermographic techniques is based on a 1D heat transfer model and does not take into account 3D heat transfer. These methods are applicable only for large defects, which lateral size can be assumed as infinite. In contrast, the presented technique takes into account lateral dimension of defects and a finite thickness of a tested material. The method is based on a modification of the 1D analytical solution obtained by Almond et al. and a nonlinear optimization procedure. The algorithm was verified by numerical modelling and flash-pulse thermographic inspection experiments. Applicability of the method for the defect depth evaluation in the duraluminum parts was demonstrated. © METAL 2022. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing or 3D printing offers a fast and convenient way of fabricating parts. The additive manufacturing method can create not only complex (intricate) part structures (geometries), which are not possible or very expensive if using conventional subtractive manufacturing methods, but also to create parts with significantly less material's waste compared to conventional subtractive manufacturing methods, which is potentially an excellent benefit for the 3D-printed parts’ life-cycle assessment to be environmentally friendly. Stereolithography (SLA) is a promising method for creating parts for vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB), as SLA produces watertight and isotropic parts, unlike those made by as-printed fused filament fabrication (FFF) technology. Previous studies lack systematic investigation of material compatibility of SLA 3D-printed parts subjected to VRFB electrolyte or sulfuric acid. Herein, we tested the chemical compatibility, tensile mechanical strength, and swelling after immersion to 6.0 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solution, following ASTM D543 standard for testing the resistance of plastics to chemical reagents, as well as the watertightness of test specimens, which were 3D-printed from a feedstock of High-Temp-V2 resin (Formlabs, USA). We found no significant change in the material dimension, weight, and tensile strength between pristine and post-submerged specimens. In another experiment utilizing 1200 ml/min of VRFB electrolyte (51 % V3+ and 49 % V4+ + 2 mol L−1 H2SO4) on one side and 50 ml/min of de-ionized water (DI water) on the other side, we found the SLA 3D-printed part can withstand the pressure from the flowing liquids, and is watertight with no major leakage; however, we observed an increase in water conductivity (from 1.4 µS/cm to 8.4 µS/cm after 96 hours) due to small amount of H+ ion crossed through the 300-micrometer-thickness material, as evidenced from the pH increase of the DI water. Given the apparent slow rate of transfer (the ionic-conductivity increment is very low, which is four order-of-magnitude smaller compared to that of the VRFB electrolyte at 228.8 mS/cm), it would take significantly large timescales to detect the equilibrium concentration for both sides. Utilizing this study's valuable information for applying SLA 3D-printed material for VRFB systems, we demonstrated producing complex specialized / customized designs for VRFB, such as 3D-printed flow frame, 3D-printed bespoke sensor mounting, and 3D-printed customized tank. We also observed that translucent 3D-printed parts are useful for quick visual inspection of electrolyte flow for VRFB troubleshooting and diagnosis. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {3D ground-penetrating radar can realize rapid non-destructive detection of the structure interior compared with conventional inspection and has the advantages of high efficiency and high resolution, which has its unique advantages when applied to road inspection and disease identification. Since the setting of the parameters of the radar acquisition software has a large impact on the quality of disease mapping, it is necessary to carry out research on the optimal parameters of radar under different detection needs. In order to obtain the optimal parameter settings for the optimal 3D radar images under different working conditions, the best parameter settings under different detection demands are obtained through orthogonal tests using extreme difference analysis, with sampling spacing, dwell time and speed as factors, and information entropy and energy gradient as evaluation indexes, and by analyzing and evaluating the test results. The results show that the parameter settings for the best results of the data acquisition software vary greatly under different needs, and the parameter settings for the detection of internal road damage are 5cm sampling spacing, 2μs residence time, and the best image at a speed of 10km/h; and the recommended parameters for the thickness detection are 8cm sampling spacing, 2μs residence time, and the speed does not exceed the maximum speed limit. The results of this study provide theoretical and practical significance for the better application and promotion of ground-penetrating radar in road detection. © 2024 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Background: 3D printing (3DP) has enabled medical professionals to create patient-specific medical devices to assist in surgical planning. Anatomical models can be generated from patient scans using a wide array of software, but there are limited studies on the geometric variance that is introduced during the digital conversion of images to models. The final accuracy of the 3D printed model is a function of manufacturing hardware quality control and the variability introduced during the multiple digital steps that convert patient scans to a printable format. This study provides a brief summary of common algorithms used for segmentation and refinement. Parameters for each that can introduce geometric variability are also identified. Several metrics for measuring variability between models and validating processes are explored and assessed. Methods: Using a clinical maxillofacial CT scan of a patient with a tumor of the mandible, four segmentation and refinement workflows were processed using four software packages. Differences in segmentation were calculated using several techniques including volumetric, surface, linear, global, and local measurements. Results: Visual inspection of print-ready models showed distinct differences in the thickness of the medial wall of the mandible adjacent to the tumor. Volumetric intersections and heatmaps provided useful local metrics of mismatch or variance between models made by different workflows. They also allowed calculations of aggregate percentage agreement and disagreement which provided a global benchmark metric. For the relevant regions of interest (ROIs), statistically significant differences were found in the volume and surface area comparisons for the final mandible and tumor models, as well as between measurements of the nerve central path. As with all clinical use cases, statistically significant results must be weighed against the clinical significance of any deviations found. Conclusions: Statistically significant geometric variations from differences in segmentation and refinement algorithms can be introduced into patient-specific models. No single metric was able to capture the true accuracy of the final models. However, a combination of global and local measurements provided an understanding of important geometric variations. The clinical implications of each geometric variation is different for each anatomical location and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by clinicians familiar with the process. Understanding the basic segmentation and refinement functions of software is essential for sites to create a baseline from which to evaluate their standard workflows, user training, and inter-user variability when using patient-specific models for clinical interventions or decisions. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The key components of the fully mechanized mining equipment are severely worn during the operation of the equipment, resulting in equipment failure and large economic losses. The new wear-resistant composite material has excellent wear resistance and strength. The use of it in the key components of the equipment can effectively increase the service life of the coal mining equipment components, thereby reducing the cost in the coal mining process. Therefore, the research on the key application technology of new wear-resistant composite material had important practical value. Composite casting technology was a common combination technology of composite materials and mechanical parts. The key of the composite casting method to prepare parts is whether the clad metal and the composite material can be combined stably. The key to the stable combination of the two was whether the interface between the two was stable. Therefore, the study of the interface between the two has important theoretical significance. In this paper, vacuum sintering method was used to prepare zirconia toughened alumina iron matrix (ZTAp-Fe) composite. The metal matrix material was iron-based self-fluxing alloy powder with an average particle size of 50 μm, ZTA particles with an average particle size of 2 mm were selected as the reinforcing phase. And the QM-3SP4 planetary ball mill was used for mixing, PP-100S full-automatic tablet press was used to press the mixed powder into a green body, and the green body was placed in ZT-40-20 vacuum carbon tube sintering furnace for vacuum sintering, then, the Japanese Rigaku company type D/mas-250p X-ray diffractometer (XRD) was used to analyze the phase composition of ZTAp-Fe composite. In the composite casting experiment, the pouring temperature was 1650 ℃, ZTAp-Fe composite size was 100 mm×67 mm×40 mm, the casting size was 100 mm×67 mm×40 mm, and the sand mold material was industrial water, the size of glass sand and sand mould was 300 mm×210 mm×160 mm. ProCAST software was used to perform composite casting numerical simulation, including the entire process of filling and solidification in the composite casting process. The 3D modeling software UG was used to create the model, the size of the model was the same as the actual casting size, and the created 3D model was imported into the Procast software. The model was checked and the mesh was divided in the Mesh module. The parameters in the Cast module were set as follows: the initial temperature was 25 ℃, the pouring temperature was 1650 ℃, and the filling time was 10 min. Finally, the numerical simulation was completed and viewed in the Viewer module. The simulation results showed that, the surface temperature change and internal temperature field distribution of ZTAp-Fe composite in the composite casting were investigated through the finite element simulation, the microscopic observation and element analysis of the interface between the cladding of the casting material and the preform were carried out to explore ZTAp-Fe composite. The interface of ZTAp-Fe composite casting sample was studied by the method of combining theoretical simulation calculation and experiment. X-ray inspection results showed that the phase composition of ZTAp-Fe composite was α-(Fe-Cr-Ni), FeCrB, Cr7C3, Al2O3 and ZrO2. Among them, α-(Fe-Cr-Ni), FeCrB and Cr7C3 were the main phases of iron-based alloys, and Al2O3 and ZrO2 were the main phases of ZTAp. The numerical simulation results of composite casting showed that the surface temperature field of ZTAp-Fe composite was uniformly distributed during the whole process of composite casting, and the maximum temperature exceeded the liquidus temperature of ZTAp-Fe composite for a period of time. Observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), it was found that the interface between the coated metal and ZTAp-Fe composite was well bonded, and there was no obvious defect. Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) result showed that the element distribution at the interface was uniform. During the vacuum sintering process, ZTAp did not chemically react with other raw materials to generate new phases. After sintering, ZTAp was subjected to compressive stress, and the iron matrix was subjected to tensile stress, forming thermal expansion dislocation strengthening. The finite element numerical simulation calculation of the surface temperature change and the internal temperature field distribution of ZTAp-Fe composite showed that ZTAp-Fe composite matrix and coating could be fused. When the pouring temperature was 1650 ℃, the composite casting was performed. The interface between ZTAp-Fe composite and the cladding layer was well bonded, and the thickness of the interface transition layer was about 10 μm. The elements at the interface between ZTAp-Fe composite and the cladding layer diffused each other to form a metallurgical bond. © 2022, Youke Publishing Co., Ltd. All right reserved.},

	abstract = {3D measurement techniques have permeated sectors like intelligent manufacturing and online inspection, demanding higher real-time performance in industrial applications. Recently, deep-learning-based profilometry (DLP) has gained significant attention due to the powerful feature extraction capabilities of convolutional neural networks, enabling single-shot projection to meet both real-time and robustness requirements in dynamic measurement scenarios. However, while these methods yield promising results, they predominantly emphasize model improvements (e.g., optimizing module functionality or expanding network parameters) often neglecting the parallel integration with traditional physical models and the optimization of input features. To overcome these limitations, a novel DLP that combines parallel phase-shifting theory with a fringe restoration network has been proposed and leverages a high-quality dataset, balancing the trade-offs between projection efficiency and reconstruction accuracy: (1) A learning-based spatial composite phase-shifting profilometry (LSCPP) is proposed, marking the first application of equal thickness interference theory from digital holography to DLP. This mitigates pixel loss caused by frequency-domain filtering in FTP while ensuring high-precision fringe reconstruction without auxiliary templates; (2) A multi-exposure dataset is constructed, accompanied by the introduction of a novel evaluation metric, modulation error rate (MER), for performance assessment; (3) Extensive experiments are conducted across both static and dynamic scenarios, utilizing multi-exposure and public datasets, and are compared with state-of-the-art DLPs. It demonstrates the proposed LSCPP's real-time capability and generalization performance in dynamic measurement environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Remanufacturing is an industrial process of turning used products into products with the same quality as new ones. Of the processes comprising remanufacturing, the repair process poses the greatest challenge. Additive manufacturing (AM) is expected to bring innovation to the repair process of remanufacturing. Although, so far, the directed energy deposition (DED) type AM has been most frequently applied to remanufacturing and only a few studies applied powder bed fusion (PBF) type AM to remanufacturing, PBF demonstrates great potential for application in remanufacturing. This study aims to assess the feasibility of the application of PBF to remanufacturing. We conducted an experimental PBF-based repair and attempted to identify its challenges. In the experiment, 1) we used AlSi10Mg powder, 2) we first fabricated a 5 mm square cube sample by using PBF, 3) we next removed 0.4 mm of thickness from the sample with milling, 4) then we restored 0.44 mm of thickness using PBF, and 5) we observed the restored sample. The observation showed that: 1) misalignment in the restoration occurred, 2) keyhole defects and gas pores were found more in the boundary area between the original and restored parts, and 3) the microstructures showed polycrystals in the restored part. These factors impaired the quality and reliability of PBF-based repair and present challenges of enhancing the feasibility of applying PBF-based repair to remanufacturing. This study also examined the whole process of PBFbased remanufacturing, which includes not only the repair process but also the processes of component inspection, process design, pre-repair process, and postrepair process, and discussed the challenges in these processes. The challenges include the development of repair process design methods, supportless fabrication processes, and non-destructive test (NDT) techniques. © Fuji Technology Press Ltd.},

Owing to its unique potential for fast production rates, and capacity of creating complex shapes, the number of researches on AM techniques have increased day by day in the technical literature. In this work, contrary to common literature efforts focused on mechanical properties, friction and wear behaviors of additively manufactured PETG samples were analyzed experimentally. As a methodology, fused filament fabrication (FFF) was selected. In order to explore the influence of manufacturing factors on wear properties, layer thickness (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mm), infill rate (40, 60, 80, and 100%), and building direction (vertical and horizontal) were changed. Before the friction tests, dimensional accuracy, hardness, and surface roughness measurements were conducted to interpret better the wear results. In addition, macroscopic and microscopic inspections were performed to determine the correct reason behind the deformation. From the data collected during the tests, there was a positive interaction between volume loss and layer thickness. Besides, there was no direct interaction between infill rate/building direction and coefficient of friction. In comparison with vertically built samples, horizontally built samples were subjected to more plastic deformation, and their worn surfaces were severely damaged.  © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {Cumulative second harmonic Lamb waves in nonlinear media feature increasing amplitudes with propagation distance, conducive to the monitoring of material microstructural changes in structures. The phenomenon can be readily generated by zero-order symmetric (S0) mode waves in the low-frequency range. However, in a practical piezoelectric-transducer-activated system, both S0 and A0 (zero-order antisymmetric) mode Lamb waves are inevitably excited, while only the former is responsible for cumulative effects. The generation efficiency of the cumulative second harmonics is then affected by the presence of the A0 waves. To tackle the problem, this study develops a metamaterial structure, referred to as a meta-structure, to tactically enhance the cumulative second harmonic S0 Lamb waves by converting the A0 mode components into S0 mode waves. Topology optimization is conducted to design the meta-structure, which is surface-mounted onto the structure under inspection, to achieve high-efficiency A0-to-S0 wave mode conversion. Through tuning the parameters and constraints of the optimization, the designed single-sided meta-structure breaks the structural symmetry in the thickness direction, while facilitating its practical implementation. Typical scenarios with different meta-structure materials are discussed. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the strain amplitudes of the fundamental S0 mode waves can be increased by 60% with the deployment of the meta-structure, alongside an enhancement of the second harmonic S0 mode waves at different sensing distances. Finally, the designed meta-structure is fabricated via 3D printing technique and tested experimentally on an aluminum plate subjected to thermal aging treatment for monitoring the heating-induced microstructural changes inside the structure. Experimental results confirm an increase in the wave amplitudes of the linear S0 mode waves with the assistance of the meta-structure. The developed system improves the sensitivity of nonlinear Lamb wave-based monitoring methods in characterizing material microstructural changes, which shows great promise for detecting incipient damage in practical structural health monitoring applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Bolt detection is an essential part of the train inspection system. This paper presents a novel method of wear and looseness detection of the bolt on the subway, based on the depth and intensity maps captured by a 3D line-scan camera. First, this paper adopts the aggregate channel features algorithm to locate bolts by two steps on the intensity map. Second, by combining the seeded region growing and the random sample consensus algorithm(RANSAC), the method achieves region segmentation in complex environments. RANSAC fits the plane of upper and lower surfaces of the bolt. The difference between the average depth values of inliers with the twice RANSAC is defined as the nut thickness. Third, the wear and looseness detection is realized by comparing it with the historical data. Finally, the 3D image is reconstructed to facilitate human observation. Algorithm verification has been carried out on different trains and locations of bolts. In dynamic operation, the detection success rate is above 94.44%. The relative detection error of the same vehicle with the latest data is within 0.3mm, proving the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed detection scheme. © 2021 IEEE.},

This work presents an alternative manufacturing approach in which infrared (IR) heating and the transport process of a hot preform are eliminated. In this method, a geometrically calibrated composite part is manufactured directly from a spot-welded tailored ply stack by combining heating, forming, and consolidation within a single processing unit. The manufacturing concept, referred to as 3D-consolidation, was implemented on a force-controlled consolidation production cell using a specially developed tooling solution. Instrumented experimental production trials were performed on an aerodynamic, aviation-specific component geometry produced with a tailored laminate architecture using a carbon fiber-reinforced thermoplastic unidirectional (UD) tape material based on a low-melt polyaryletherketone polymer matrix (CF/LMPAEK). The potential of the manufacturing approach was demonstrated through process data analysis and visual inspection of the fabricated composite parts. As the results show, near-net-shape manufacturing is provided, including a proper representation of the part's filigree edge sections and a regular internal laminate structure. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc..

	abstract = {Use of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite in structural and aerospace fields is often restricted in a heated service condition. The thermal-induced degradation of FRP can be complicated by the internal defects with geometrical irregularities. This highlights the need for new characterization methods capable of revealing the thermal conduction process of FRP with different types of defects. To this end, the present study establishes a state-of-the-art methodology, namely micro computed tomography based finite element analysis (μCT-based FEA), for evaluating the influence of internal defects on the thermal conductivity of FRP. The modelling work through μCT gains an insight into the actual three-dimensional (3D) meso-scale structures for various species of defects (void, needle-like cavity, air pocket/unfilled bug hole, and delamination) in FRP. From the numerical ‘virtual’ experiments, the simulated through-thickness thermal conductivities range from 0.2196 to 0.2270 W/(m·K), which are comparable with the experimental data from literature. The investigation also discovers that the unfilled bug hole and delamination decrease the effective thermal conductivity of FRP, while these defects can cause sub-surface heat concentration. In contrast, the needle-like cavity has negligible effect on the through-thickness thermal conductivity. Increasing the water saturation degree of defects leads to an exponential increase in the thermal conductivity of FRP, especially when a large air cavity or delamination is incorporated into the composite. Based on transient analysis, the relationship among temperature, heat flux intensity and exposure time is numerically determined. The research findings can motivate the applications of μCT-based FEA in quality inspection/control of manufactured polymer composite products and even in improving the thermal non-destructive testing methods for defect detection of field composite structures. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Ultrasonic inspection is an environmentally friendly and easily deployable nondestructive testing (NDT) method widely used for defect detection of critical components in the industry. Phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) is one of the most advanced ultrasonic inspection methods, which gives volume inspection with increased resolution and coverage, improving inspection efficiency. Because of the weld structure echoes and the abstract nature of ultrasound images, especially facing meters and feature-changing weld joints with different thicknesses and welding methods in shipbuilding, the analysis of the PAUT weld data still relies on experienced rater random inspections. Rating complex welded products process is lengthy, costly, and prone to introduce human error during the manual rating but challenges automatic detection. To automatically segment defects in PAUT data, this work shows a combination of PAUT data of ship weld and three-dimensional (3D) U-net architecture. Combining PAUT imaging principles with welding and scan processes, a PAUT volumetric image dataset, including different thicknesses and scan angles, is established. We pioneered the application of 3D U-net architecture to segment defects in PAUT volume data. We found that U-net architecture with two encoding stages will perform better in segmenting defects in PAUT data, and region-based loss mainly improves the accuracy. Furthermore, a lightweight U-net architecture containing skip-connection and residual blocks is proposed with precision and efficiency improvement. The validation results show that the proposed U-net architecture offers a feasible solution to the problem of segmenting defects from PAUT data with a Dice accuracy of 90.9 %. Segmentation results help to locate and measure defects. This method makes locating and sizing defects in PAUT weld data possible within a fraction of a second. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Medical ultrasound (US) system quality assurance (QA) is employed only modestly by users because of the large number of variables recommended for measurement and the relatively low use of all that information when it is acquired. By 2011 it was again clear that the equipment was not as reliable as often contended; that failures were mainly transducer, cable, and visible mechanical effects, easily addressed by uniformity tests and visual inspections. Monitor degradation also became more widely recognized. Recently it was proposed that system imaging performance QA could be accomplished by simple, cine loop acquisitions with a random hypoechoic sphere phantom (RHSP). With automated analysis, this should detect almost all B mode image quality difficulties and sources of most defects in other modes. The measures, based on the spheres' mean lesion signal-to-noise ratios (LSNRms), also would be absolute tests in 3D and valid for acceptance testing and comparisons, providing intuitive results for users to anticipate a transducer's utility in various depths and applications. This challenge to traditional phantoms has stimulated improvement in more traditional polymer filament or wire phantoms, making it easier to see poor slice thickness, but with considerable acquisition effort and cost. Purpose: To evaluate the potential and ease of use of the commercially available RHSPs, we compared them with a new wire phantom and an established uniformity phantom for detecting physically simulated, common transducer defects, using commercially available automated analysis. Methods: The three types of transducer defects were simulated physically for comparison with the same, undisrupted, transducer. A layer of Styrofoam was taped over either one end of the array, one side of the array, one part of one side of the array, or not at all, essentially blocking all of the elements on one end or one side, or just part of the elevational extent of the involved elements. Scanning methods and analysis, generally described in IEC TS62736, provided median lesion signal-to-noise ratio (LSNRm) and clarity index (Ci) on the spheres, −6 dB pulse-echo response widths on the wires and median signal level on the uniformity phantom and RHSP. Several defective transducers were evaluated as well. Results: The RHSP phantom/analysis gave consistent results, with delineation of the lateral and the full elevational disruptions, but only meager delineation of the partial elevational disruption given chosen settings. Beam width measurements on the 90°/45° wire phantom delineated all three disruptions but were more difficult to perform and function over limited settings. The uniformity measurements revealed only the lateral disruption. Conclusions: The RHSP phantom is now available at a considerably lower cost than wire-based phantoms. It demonstrated good detection of all but the subtlest disruption. We preliminarily recommend this phantom for US system user QA and performance evaluation, after initial verification on each model of the system of the grayscale characteristic curve and spatial measurements. Quantitative expectations for different US systems will develop rapidly, as more users will be implementing this simpler QA. Software or phantom modifications can add evaluation of spatial measurements. © 2025 The Author(s).

	abstract = {In order to ensure high weld qualities and structural integrity of engineering structures, it is crucial to detect areas of high stress concentrations along weld seams. Traditional inspection methods rely on visual inspection and manual weld geometry measurements. Recent advances in the field of automated measurement techniques allow virtually unrestricted numbers of inspections by laser measurements of weld profiles; however, in order to compare weld qualities of different welding processes and manufacturers, a deeper understanding of statistical distributions of stress concentrations along weld seams is required. Hence, this study presents an approach to statistically characterize different types of butt joint weld seams. For this purpose, an artificial neural network is created from 945 finite element simulations to determine stress concentration factors at butt joints. Besides higher quality of predictions compared to empirical estimation functions, the new approach can directly be applied to all types welded structures, including arc-and laser-welded butt joints, and coupled with all types of 3D-measurement devices. Furthermore, sheet thickness ranging from 1 mm to 100 mm can be assessed. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The use of Pipeline Inspection Gauges (PIGs) to clean the pipes and understand the exact location of existing pipes is essential to protect them from damage during operation. In-depth study of the most important component sealing disc is a new method to solve the failure of the current PIG in the working process. This study focuses on redesigning the sealing disc in combination with soft robot drive technology. First, the structure of a new multi-airbag sealing disc is composed of a conventional sealing disc and a plurality of airbags located above it. Then, the multi-airbag sealing disc was successfully fabricated by using 3D printing technology and multi-step molding, and finally the active control of the multi-airbag sealing disc was realized by inflating the airbag. For the newly designed multi-airbag sealing disc, the most important concern is the bending angle β of the sealing disc and the expansion ratio η of the airbag. Numerical and experimental results were compared to verify the accuracy of the numerical method. Based on this method, the effects of the position of the airbag, the height rate, and the thickness rate on the bending angle of the multi-airbag sealing disc and the expansion ratio of the airbag were studied. The results show that at a given air pressure, the position of the airbag does not substantially affect the expansion ratio of the airbag itself, and the smaller the distance between the airbag and the outer edge of the sealing disc, the easier it is to bend the sealing disc. The larger the height rate, the smaller the thickness rate, and the larger the bending angle of the sealing disc, the larger the expansion ratio of the airbag. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

We present a geometric feedback system that is integrated within a robotic setup and includes a set of depth cameras used for acquiring data on sprayed concrete structures, during and after fabrication. The acquired data are analyzed in terms of thickness and surface quality, with both sets of information then used within the adaptive fabrication process. The thickness evaluation is based on the comparison of the as-built state to a previous as-built state or to the design model. The surface quality evaluation is based on the local analysis of 3D geometric and intensity features. These features are used by a random forest classifier trained using data manually labelled by a skilled professional. With this approach, we are able to achieve a prediction accuracy of 87 % or better when distinguishing different surface quality types on flat specimens, and 75 % when applied in a full production setting with wet and non-planar surfaces. The presented approach is a contribution towards in-line material thickness and surface quality inspection within digital fabrication. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In the continuously growing field of dielectric elastomers (DE) research is increasingly focusing on promising new production technologies with regard to reproducibility and flexibility. Challenges in production remain, especially the handling of thin elastomer films and applying the covering electrodes, which are in the range of several 10 and single-digit micrometers, respectively. Various fabrication processes, e.g. spin coating, blade casting, or sequential assembly of prefabricated elastomer films have so far been applied. Direct ink writing (DIW), or more precisely robocasting, is presented in this work for applying the elastomer layer. It is based on the extrusion of liquid elastomer in a wide viscosity range. This contribution presents printing of the elastomer layers by a DIW printer and evaluates the printing technology in terms of a fabrication method for dielectric elastomer transducers (DET). The requirements for 3D printing of DET are a homogeneous layer structure with low variation of the layer thickness, dimensional stability, and the avoidance of air inclusions. Considering these requirements, printing tests are conducted with the two-component silicone rubber ELASTOSIL RT 625 (Wacker Chemie AG, Germany). Elastomer layers are printed by varying the printing parameters, such as, the nozzle geometry and the printing speed. An optical inspection is implemented both to optimize the printing and to evaluate the result. In line with these objectives, the proposed process is evaluated by measuring the layer thickness and analyzing images of the printed elastomer layers. A minimum thickness for a single layer of approximately 40 µm was achieved. © 2022 SPIE.},

	abstract = {Adhesively bonded Polymeric Matrix Composite (PMC) structures could offer significant cost savings and increase production rates in the fabrication and assembly of future composite airframes. In particular, bonded PMCs may eliminate the use of thousands of mechanical fasteners and allow incorporation of multiple aircraft composite primary structures into a unitized structural design. However, increased susceptibility to defects and manufacturing irregularities, including voids, disbonds, and geometry variations, as well as complex interacting failure mechanisms, hinder a widespread use of bonded PMCs. Inherent susceptibility to manufacturing defects contributes to higher variability of part quality than found in structures manufactured using fasteners. The presence of microstructural defects at critical locations may significantly reduce strength and useful life of adhesively bonded structures. At the same time, existing methods for simulation of the performance of bonded PMCs are based on homogenization and similitude of material response and an incomplete physical understanding of the failure processes involved. Such approaches have proven unable to capture the effects of defects on structural performance and explain large data scatter commonly observed. Hence, these methods do not provide the level of confidence needed for qualification and certification of bonded interfaces. Certification of adhesively bonded interfaces currently used in primary aircraft PMC structures requires installation of fasteners to produce a redundant load path. This redundancy greatly increases production time and expense, and requires additional inspection and sealing. The need to develop a high-fidelity computational materials-based capability to support next-generation qualification and certification of bonded PMCs and safely reduce redundant fasteners has been identified under NASA Transformational Tools and Technologies (TTT) program. As part of such effort, this work presents the current work- in-progress towards the development of an integrated methodology to enable improved understanding of the failure mechanisms that govern performance along a bonded PMC interface in presence of manufacturing defects. The approach is envisioned to integrate (1) accurate 3D measurement of bondline defects and irregularities, including X- ray Computed Tomography (CT) data; (2) allow for input of material properties from experimental evaluation meeting the material input data requirements; and (3) conduct a finite element-based progressive damage and failure analysis (PDFA) capturing the multiple damage modes and their interaction at the bonded interface, and predicting the structural behavior. Due to the observed effects of defects location, size and shape upon structural behavior, the proposed numerical approach considers a finite element (FE) model where the adhesive layer is discretized at the sub- bondline thickness level using a solid layer of continuum elements and incorporates discrete representations of the critical defects. Preliminary results are presented using a continuum description of the adhesive material in combination with the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) for prediction of cohesive failure within the adhesive. The approach is implemented in commercial FE software Abaqus for simulation of bondline fracture in adhesively bonded mode I Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) PMCs specimens. © 2023, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This tool is widely used in the semiconductor industry for metrology CD measurements and is one of the most common inspection methods. The CDSEM tool ZX has advanced techniques that not only measure line width but also build a 3D model of the scan. The CDSEM tool measures the sidewall angle by determining the top and bottom positions of the photomask pattern, and using the data obtained from these positions, the distance of the horizontal and vertical can be calculated. These data are then used in an algorithmic equation to simulate the slope value and calculate the sidewall angle. To verify the correctness of the sidewall angle value obtained through CDSEM measurements, TEM (transmission electron microscopy) is used. TEM is an intuitive method that uses a high-energy electron beam to capture high-resolution cross-sectional images of larger materials such as photomasks. TEM is a common method for analyzing the sidewall angle and thickness of thin films and is widely used in material science and nanotechnology. However, TEM's cross-section implementation is a destructive method and is not an ideal method for testing product photomasks. In this study, the simulated data from CDSEM and actual cross-sectional data from TEM are collected and integrated for cross-comparison to obtain the corresponding relationship. © 2023 SPIE.},

	abstract = {The rebar installation quality significantly impacts the safety and durability of reinforced concrete (RC) structures. Traditional manual inspection is time-consuming, inefficient, and highly subjective. In order to solve this problem, this study uses a depth camera and aims to develop an intelligent inspection method for the rebar installation quality of an RC slab. The Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) method is used to extract point cloud data for the bottom formwork, the upper and lower rebar lattices, and individual rebars. These data are utilized to measure the concrete cover thickness, the distance between the upper and lower rebar lattices, and the spacing between rebars in the RC slab. This paper introduces the concept of the “diameter calculation region” and combines point cloud semantic information with rebar segmentation mask information through the relationship between pixel coordinates and camera coordinates to measure the nominal diameter of the rebar. The verification results indicate that the maximum deviations for the concrete cover thickness, the distance between the upper and lower rebar lattices, and the spacing of the double-layer bidirectional rebar in the RC slab are 0.41 mm, 1.32 mm, and 5 mm, respectively. The accuracy of the nominal rebar diameter measurement reaches 98.4%, demonstrating high precision and applicability for quality inspection during the actual construction stage. Overall, this study integrates computer vision into traditional civil engineering research, utilizing depth cameras to acquire point cloud data and color results. It replaces inefficient manual inspection methods with an intelligent and efficient approach, addressing the challenge of detecting double-layer reinforcement. This has significant implications for practical engineering applications and the development of intelligent engineering monitoring systems. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The gradual growth of oxides inside thermal barrier coatings is a key factor leading to the degradation of thermal barrier coating performance until its failure, and accurate monitoring of the growth stress during this process is crucial to ensure the long-term stable operation of engines. In this study, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy was introduced as a new method to characterize the growth stress in thermal barrier coatings. By combining metallographic analysis and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation techniques, the real microstructure of the oxide layer was obtained, and an accurate simulation model of the oxide growth was constructed on this basis. The elastic solutions of the thermally grown oxide layer of thermal insulation coatings were obtained by using the controlling equations in the rate-independent theoretical model, and the influence of the thickness of the thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer on the stress distribution was explored. Based on experimental data, multidimensional 3D numerical models of thermal barrier coatings with different TGO thicknesses were constructed, and the terahertz time-domain responses of oxide coatings with different thicknesses were simulated using the time-domain finite difference method to simulate the actual inspection scenarios. During the simulation process, white noise with signal-to-noise ratios of 10 dB to 20 dB was embedded to approximate the actual detection environment. After adding the noise, wavelet transform (WT) was used to reduce the noise in the data. The results showed that the wavelet transform had excellent noise reduction performance. For the problems due to the large data volume and small sample data after noise reduction, local linear embedding (LLE) and kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM) were used, respectively, and the kernel function was optimized using the gray wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm to improve the model’s immunity to interference. Experimental validation showed that the proposed LLE-GWO-KELM hybrid model performed well in predicting the TGO growth stress of thermal insulation coatings. In this study, a novel, efficient, nondestructive, online, and high-precision measurement method for the growth in TGO stress of thermal barrier coatings was developed, which provides reliable technical support for evaluating the service life of thermal barrier coatings. © 2025 by the authors.},

The changes in mechanical structure via flexural bending and cracking can be detected by monitoring the deviations in electrical impedance signals recorded with embedded PZT sensors. This paper has conducted a comprehensive study on the potential of an EMI technique with embedded PZT sensors with 3D Concrete Printing (3DCP) structures subjected to flexural bending test until plastic failure. The impact of different Piezoelectric housing methods and materials has been studied comprehensively through the monitoring of EMI signals. Experimental results indicate that material housing types and thickness affect the sensitivity of EMI readings but also performed as a reinforcement when a load is directly applied. The embedded PZT sensors with the EMI technique have shown strong potential to address the cost and lifecycle challenges posed by traditional construction methods as the insertion of PZT sensors seamlessly functions with 3DCP workflows. Further developmental work can be carried out to address the sensitivity of the sensor, performance as a reinforcement, and installation automation. The results proved that the coated sensors could detect fractures in 3DCP concrete with decreased sensitivity on thicker coating layers through the variance in materials and coating thickness in the paper. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: In vitro fertilization (IVF) has emerged as a transformative solution for infertility. However, achieving favorable live-birth outcomes remains challenging. Current clinical IVF practices in IVF involve the collection of heterogeneous embryo data through diverse methods, including static images and temporal videos. However, traditional embryo selection methods, primarily reliant on visual inspection of morphology, exhibit variability and are contingent on the experience of practitioners. Therefore, an automated system that can evaluate heterogeneous embryo data to predict the final outcomes of live births is highly desirable. Methods: We employed artificial intelligence (AI) for embryo morphological grading, blastocyst embryo selection, aneuploidy prediction, and final live-birth outcome prediction. We developed and validated the AI models using multitask learning for embryo morphological assessment, including pronucleus type on day 1 and the number of blastomeres, asymmetry, and fragmentation of blastomeres on day 3, using 19,201 embryo photographs from 8271 patients. A neural network was trained on embryo and clinical metadata to identify good-quality embryos for implantation on day 3 or day 5, and predict live-birth outcomes. Additionally, a 3D convolutional neural network was trained on 418 time-lapse videos of preimplantation genetic testing (PGT)-based ploidy outcomes for the prediction of aneuploidy and consequent live-birth outcomes. Results: These two approaches enabled us to automatically assess the implantation potential. By combining embryo and maternal metrics in an ensemble AI model, we evaluated live-birth outcomes in a prospective cohort that achieved higher accuracy than experienced embryologists (46.1% vs. 30.7% on day 3, 55.0% vs. 40.7% on day 5). Our results demonstrate the potential for AI-based selection of embryos based on characteristics beyond the observational abilities of human clinicians (area under the curve: 0.769, 95% confidence interval: 0.709-0.820). These findings could potentially provide a noninvasive, high-throughput, and low-cost screening tool to facilitate embryo selection and achieve better outcomes. Conclusions: Our study underscores the AI model's ability to provide interpretable evidence for clinicians in assisted reproduction, highlighting its potential as a noninvasive, efficient, and cost-effective tool for improved embryo selection and enhanced IVF outcomes. The convergence of cutting-edge technology and reproductive medicine has opened new avenues for addressing infertility challenges and optimizing IVF success rates.

	abstract = {Featured Application: Through the use of high-precision 3D virtual reconstruction techniques, together with comparison algorithms, this study is a clear advance in the field of building execution and, more specifically, in the prevention of occupational risks during the said process from the point of view of its management, inspection, evaluation, and control. It is about introducing high-precision 3D reconstruction technologies, which, when applied during the execution of construction projects, allow better monitoring. These 3D reconstructions are generated through terrestrial laser scanner records in different phases of the work, capturing processes and operators with simultaneous activity and their possible interferences and thus associated risks. With this, the responsible agents can evaluate the prevention strategies to follow and choose the most appropriate ones. On the other hand, this 3D virtual technology allows construction managers to analyze the model with the aim of improving quality standards in construction, being able to determine very precise and detailed data of the work in each phase without the need to be in the same. The findings remind project managers of the advantages of these technologies to make their work easier, especially in cases of project complexity, uncertainty in the dating and available information, and interactions between different operators. In the intelligent manufacturing process and digitization, new research spaces have been created, such as reverse engineering and its use for the detection of risks in construction. For this reason, in this research, an analysis methodology is proposed that, through terrestrial laser scanner records in different phases of the work, allows for an analysis and evaluation of the identification of security risks. In addition, by capturing different processes, it can be determined not only interferences from different operators that can generate risk but also establish quality standards in construction, such as determining the thicknesses of the coating of the concrete manufactured “in situ”. Therefore, this research responds to quality analysis in the material execution of the activity and construction of formwork systems and their safety, as well as defining the location of the static and dynamic elements of the model. This value of the morphometric parameter of the building and the scene to be represented characterizes the morphometrics of the work execution activities and finally evaluates the semantic information model of the BIM construction, in which the deformations between the ideal model and what was executed. With the results of this study, it can be concluded that the latest 3D model reconstruction techniques (BIM), together with comparison algorithms, can determine millimeter precision, and with that, it can establish a better method for inspection, evaluation, and control through non-destructive technology. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Adult bone age assessment is an important part of forensic anthropological age assessment, which includes items such as adult living body bone age assessment, unknown cadaver bone age assessment, and ossified cadaver bone age assessment. Traditional assessment methods are mainly applicable to unknown and ossified cadavers. Adult living body age assessment requires extracting high-definition models of pelvic volume reconstruction (VR), and then referring to traditional methods for assessment. The purpose of this study is to explore the necessary conditions for establishing a high-definition model extraction method for pelvic volume reconstruction, which solves the problem of setting parameters for multi-slice spiral CT (MSCT) scanning and reconstruction in the process of pelvic 3D imaging sampling for adult bone age assessment. This study used Precision32 (Kaiying Company) MSCT with protocol fixed tube voltage of 120 kV, tube current of 250 mA, pitch of 1.05, layer thickness of 1.1 mm, spacing of 0.8 mm, and matrix 512 × 512 to scan fresh corpse pelvis, and adjust reconstruction parameters such as filtering, layer thickness, layer spacing, matrix, etc. to compare the clarity of pelvic volume reconstruction images, and select the necessary parameter values. The research results indicate that filtering, layer thickness, layer spacing, matrix, etc. have a significant impact on the clarity of volume reconstruction images. Choosing pelvic filtering, thin layer thickness, short layer spacing, and large matrix can improve the clarity of pelvic VR models. Therefore, under the premise of using scanning parameters such as protocol tube voltage and tube current, it’s necessary to choose pelvic filtering, thin layer thickness, short layer spacing, large matrix, etc. to establish a high-definition model for pelvic volume reconstruction. © 2024, Editorial Office of Forensic Science and Technology.

	abstract = {Corrosion is a prevalent damage aspect of aged highway bridges. In case of steel viaducts, the phenomenon is more intense close to the support due to malfunctioning expansion joints which fail to prevent water from penetrating into the supersaturate level. Engineers, to ensure public safety, estimate the load bearing capacity of deteriorated bridges by performing thickness measurements along the corroded girders. Established data collection methods are highly dependent on inspectors judgment and they are characterized by measurements short comings. To address these weaknesses, this study explores the use of 3D scanning for the capacity evaluation of damaged beams. Field corroded girders are scanned in the laboratory, and contours maps are created as an approach for mapping the remaining material of corroded parts of the girder. The performance of the proposed methodology is validated with thickness measurements taken by an ultrasonic thickness gauge as well as with full scale experimental testing of a field corroded girder. The post processed point clouds are combined with finite element modeling of the tested girder as well as with closed form equations to examine whether point clouds data can inform these two tools reasonably for accurate capacity predictions. The emerging conclusion is that 3D scanning can be a valuable tool for future modernization of the current inspection techniques towards a more detailed and efficient inspection protocol. © 2022 the Author(s).},

	abstract = {Significance Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is considered to be the most promising technology for fabricating technology nodes of 7 nm and below in high volume manufacturing (HVM). Due to the shrinkage of semiconductor device features and the increase in process complexity, achieving an acceptable yield is challenging. Edge placement error (EPE) quantifies the pattern fidelity of a device structure created in a multi-patterning scheme. It is urgent to reduce EPE to guarantee the proper functioning of semiconductor devices. Therefore, controlling EPE is one of the most serious challenges in the field of multi-patterning and EUV lithography. EPE is a complex metric, involving error components from various process steps (e. g., lithography and etching steps). It is the combination of critical dimension (CD) errors and overlay errors (see Fig. 1(a)). The ratio of each component to the EPE budget changes with the iteration of the logic node (see Fig. 1(b)). Stochastic contributions to the EPE budget are increasing rapidly (>50%). Hence, the accurate estimation and measurement of each component of EPE, particularly the stochastic components, are critical to enabling a holistic approach to EPE control and thereby improving the yield. A holistic approach is adopted to optimize the EPE budget (see Fig. 2). This review is organized in five parts. First, we take a broad view of EPE in EUV lithography. Second, we highlight the characteristics peculiar to EUV lithography, considering the optical proximity correction (OPC) and stochastics. Third, we discuss two EPE models, including the optimization flow and the calculation process of EPE from metrology inputs (e. g., CD and overlay). Fourth, we present the metrologies of CD and overlay errors, summarizing the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Finally, we discuss the techniques for EPE. Progress The typical deep ultraviolet (DUV) immersion lithography works with a transmissive mask, while EUV works with a reflective one (see Fig. 4). In addition, the EUV mask is exposed under oblique incidence. Some characteristics such as flare, mask absorber behavior, and mask three-dimensional effects (M3D effects) need to be considered. For instance, M3D effects cause wafer-level deviations from the intended design of an integrated circuit. To address these issues, OPC can be used. The EUV OPC model error contribution of each physical effect is presented in Fig. 5(a). Typically, rule-based and model-based approaches are used. Sub-resolution assist features (SRAF) can be used to improve the depth of focus and exposure latitude at a given pitch. In addition, exploring machine learning OPC is also an important tendency. For EUV lithography, due to off-axis illumination and the large ratio between absorber thickness (50‒100 nm) and operating wavelength (13.5 nm), the mask needs rigorous electromagnetic field (EMF) solvers to simulate the light diffraction from the mask. The finite difference time domain (FDTD) method can be used to simulate the 3D masks, but it is computationally expensive and time-consuming. An approximate M3D filter calculation method based on an M3D library and a mask defocus is applied to predict the patterns on wafers. The energy of EUV (13.5 nm, ~92 eV) is larger than the resist atomic species' electron binding energies, and ionization is the main mechanism. In resist, the electrons can travel farther than 10 nm, which has implications for the understanding of noise, critical dimension uniformity (CDU), and line edge roughness (LER) variations. The stochastic nature of EUV lithography brings many undesirable effects, and it becomes worse when trying to manufacture at high resolution and high throughput. For EUV lithography, local critical dimension uniformity (LCDU) and LER are typically large because of the increased presence of stochastic noise in low doses. Three main approaches to controlling stochastics exist (see Fig. 6(a)). The stochastics can be simulated by Monte Carlo models or multivariate Poisson propagation models (MPPM). For the most advanced nodes, stochastics are generally considered to be the dominant aspect of an EPE budget. It is necessary to explore new methods to properly account for the stochastics in EPE budgets. Mulkens et al. provide a method that is widely applied. It is a computational method that links different EPE budget components. The definition of EPE is shown in Fig. 7(a). The calculation process of EPE from various CD and overlay metrology inputs is illustrated in Fig. 7(b). The EPE optimization flow (a five-step iterative process) is presented in Fig. 7(c). Mack et al. propose a more rigorous, stochastics-aware disposition approach for complementary lithography. By using measurable quantities, this model realizes the accurate prediction of EPE-based failure rates for lot dispositioning. The above two models are reviewed. With the CD shrinkage, the complex 3D architectures also increase. Worse still, for high NA EUV lithography, due to the reduction in the depth of focus, we apply thinner resist films (<15 nm). It brings a great challenge to conventional CD metrology (e. g., optical CD and CD-SEM). The mechanism, key limits, and challenges of CD metrology are summarized. Computational imaging is a promising technique because of the merits of higher resolution and a larger optical field of view. Tight and effective overlay control is essential to securing yield. The main contributors to the overlay budget are the scanner, mask, process, and overlay metrology. The overlay optimization flow is illustrated in Fig. 10(b). Optical overlay metrology has been widely adopted for overlay control. Imaging-based overlay (IBO) and diffraction-based overlay (DBO) are the two dominant technologies. The schematic overlay metrology method of DBO is shown in Fig. 11(a)‒(e). When the logic design rules are down to 3 nm, on-product overlay (OPO) is becoming the most important factor limiting yields. Overlay error metrology and systems with higher accuracy (sub-nm scale) are in demand. The accuracy limitations of optical overlay metrology promote complementary overlay metrology (e. g., electron beam-based overlay metrology). Conclusions and Prospects Reducing EPE is essential to enabling high yields in manufacturing processes. In this paper, OPC and stochastics in EUV lithography are highlighted. Two models of EPE are reviewed, and the principal components of an EPE budget are systematically discussed. A holistic approach is significant to meet the severe demands of patterning in EPE control. It combines computational mask optimization (e. g., OPC), wafer metrology overlay/CD, co-optimization with other processes (e. g., etch), the high-order actuation capability of DUV, and an EUV scanner. New characterization techniques are critical to providing more accurate descriptions of errors in EUV lithography. Computational imaging is a promising approach by which to increase the resolution of the inspection of masks/chips. Machine learning shows economic potential in EPE analysis. This topic is of significance to the roadmap toward technology nodes of 3 nm and below in the semiconductor industry. © 2024 Science Press. All rights reserved.},

Profile quality and defects in the wafer are two key factors that should be taken into consideration. In this research, we introduce a method that measures the profile of the upper surface and the thickness of the wafer at the same time using an optical fiber cascaded Fabry–Pérot interferometer working at wavelength of 1550 nm. Therefore, the 3D profile of the wafer can be reconstructed directly. Testing results show that both accuracy and precision of the Fabry–Pérot interferometer are within a nanometer scale. Defects, especially those embedded inside the wafer, will be detected by monitoring the leaky field with treating wafers as slab waveguides. With the leaky field detection, defects on the lower surface of the wafer were successfully detected by monitoring the leaky field above the upper surface of the wafer. Compared with traditional methods such as radiographic testing or computed tomography testing, the proposed methods provide a cost-effective alternative for wafer quality evaluation.

	abstract = {Honeycomb core sandwich structures (HCSSs) are used prevalently in the aerospace and marine industries. Use of guided wave-based inspections has attracted much attention in the recent past for facilitating the NDE of such structures. This paper presents the numerical and experimental analyses of the guided wave propagation through a tapered HCSS, with a primary motive to comprehend and further utilize the alteration of local wave properties as a function of the varying thickness. To this end, a low frequency fundamental antisymmetric mode is used as an interrogation signal. The numerical analysis is performed using 3D finite element simulations, while the experiments are performed on the portion of a helicopter blade with GFRP face sheets and aluminium core. The generation of the global guided waves (GGWs) as well as continuous variation of the local wave properties (wavenumber, group velocity, and phase speed) are ascertained both numerically as well as experimentally. Least-square polynomial fits are presented for the variation of group velocity along the propagation direction. A method of predicting the time of flight utilizing a non-uniform group velocity is outlined. Using this method and the polynomial fits, predictions of time-of-flight of the fundamental antisymmetric mode are made and corroborated with the observed values. Further, to circumvent the need of the prior knowledge of the group velocity variation in predicting the time-of-flight, a generalized expression of the variation of the group velocity is developed by employing the adiabatic nature of the GGW. The present analysis and the proposed methods can find their potential use in the wave-based NDE of tapered HCSS. © 2023},

	abstract = {Objective: Traditional quantitative analysis of bone microstructure in micro-computed tomography (microCT) is dependent on animal scale and requires parametric tuning in new implementations. This study aims to develop an automated and resolution-invariant 3D image processing workflow for quantitative assessment of osteophytes. Methods: In this workflow, cortical bone was segmented from microCT scans, and a 3D sphere-fitting transform was performed to obtain a thickness map, for which each voxel is assigned a thickness value corresponding to the size of the largest sphere containing the voxel that fits entirely within the cortical bone. From the thickness map, a 1-voxel thick outer surface was extracted to model surface roughness. The thickness values of the outer surface were empirically estimated by a series of known statistical distributions. Resulting parameters describing best-fit distributions, along with other cortical bone metrics, were analysed to determine sensitivity to osteoarthritis and the presence of osteophytes. Results: The workflow was validated using microCT scans and histological gradings of rabbit and rat tibiofemoral joints. Visual inspection shows that samples with osteoarthritis and the presence of osteophytes have more surface voxels assigned small thickness values. The distribution of surface thickness values for each animal is best described by Gamma distributions, whose shape parameter is consistently sensitive to osteoarthritis and the presence of osteophytes. Conclusion: Combining traditional image processing with empirical distribution fitting provides an automated, objective, and resolution-invariant workflow for osteophyte assessment. Significance: The proposed method is simple, yet elegant in its implementation, and can be readily used in new implementations. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {White Light Interferometry（WLI）is a classic low-coherence interferometry. The surface height information can be obtained with ultra-high precision through the positioning of zero optical path difference position of white light interference. At the same time， compared with point-sectioning laser confocal microscope，WLI is a surface-sectioning tomography technology. In particular，its vertical resolution is comparable to that of an atomic force microscope. White light interferometry measurement technology has been widely used in the inspection of semiconductor wafer defects，Micro-electromechanical System （MEMS）sensing structures，ultra-precision optical components，and film thicknesses. Generally，this technology originated in the late 1980 s in the United States，and domestic researches in this field started late，with the overall technology lagging behind. In terms of the instrumentation，although there have been breakthroughs，core components still rely on imports，such as interference objectives，nano-positioning scanners. A large field-of-view white light interferometric measurement system was built and tested. In this system，a domestic white light interference objective with a lateral magnification of 2 was used and a 0.5× adapter lens was preferably configured in the imaging system in front of the image detector. For the white LED illumination source，a suitable bandpass filter was theoretically evaluated and experimentally confirmed. The center wavelength was determined through the experimental curve of white light interference along the axial direction. The actual magnification of WLI system and the distortion of the field of view were achieved through imaging of a two-dimensional microscopic grid sample. The actual maximum field-of-view at the object side has reached 14 mm. By selectively filtering the spectrum of the white light source，the white light interference signal can be effectively modulated. According to this，the axial resolution and horizontal resolution can be changed within a certain range. For example，by changing the center wavelength of the incident light，the horizontal resolution can be changed according to the Rayleigh criterion. Experimental results show that：a more ideal white light interference axial response curve is obtained through suitable spectral filtering；the maximum field-of-view at the object side is as large as 14 mm；the measurement results of standard step samples with heights of 2.04 μm and 20.43 μm are 2.05 μm and 20.47 μm，and the repeatability（standard deviation）of 10 measurements is 12 nm and 16 nm，respectively. The measurement result of the 2.04 μm height step was also compared with the result obtained by the atomic force microscope. Actual measurements were conducted on the roughness sample，MEMS sensing structure and semiconductor wafer film，demonstrating the feasibility of the developed system in the field of three-dimensional optical non-destructive precision inspection. For large field-of-view WLI systems，the horizontal or lateral resolution is on the order of a few micrometers，so it is difficult to apply WLI to the three-dimensional reconstruction of fine microstructures. This is an important shortcoming of large field-of-view WLI systems. Besides，through research，it was found that for ultra-smooth surfaces，such as polished wafers，it is difficult to measure using traditional vertical scanning interferometry technology，and the phase shifting method should be used. Measurement of film thickness may be used to monitor morphological changes in biological transparent film layers. Further research can focus on high-performance white-light interference objectives，automation of the white-light interferometry measurement process，and implementation of large field-of-view high-resolution white-light interferometry methods. © 2024 Chinese Optical Society.

GPR was used to assess wall thickness and detect potential hidden voids within the building, providing detailed information on material integrity and identifying structural anomalies. Thermography was applied to locate beams and areas affected by humidity, offering essential data for corrective interventions and structural strengthening. The combination of TLS and visual inspection enabled the creation of an accurate 3D BIM model. This method provides a detailed virtual representation of the geometry and current condition of the building, facilitating subsequent structural monitoring and allowing the inclusion of particularly useful data for future studies or restorations.

	abstract = {In the field of cultural heritage, replication has been performed for preservation, exhibition, and education purposes. In particular, due to advancement in computer technology, replication which combines the three-dimensional (3D) scanning and printing has widely performed. These technologies have been able to ensure morphological similarity as well as to avoid damaging artifacts in a contactless manner. In this study, a design mock-up for producing replacements was made for the purpose of preserving original forms, usability, and mass production for ritual utensils used in ancestral memorial rites annually. 3D precision scanner was used to obtain external information of ritual utensils and shape information of pattern parts. The measurements on height, width, and thickness of the body, and two handles and three feet showed fine shape differences, respectively. Therefore, representative models were selected and reconstructed. In addition, the upper and lower parts of the body, handles, and feet were separately manufactured for mass production by using sand casting. A model manufactured during the reverse design like above was completed by considering average shrinkage (4%) for the casting of copper-Tin alloys. A model was completed and 3D-printed with a material extrusion technique, and a design mock-up for replication was created. In this study, a 3D printing technology was applied to ritual utensils and presented a replication methodology applicable to used artifacts. For this purpose, a model suitable for the replication method was produced based on the data obtained by 3D scanning of ritual utensils. A design mock-up, which is 3D-printed with a material extrusion technique, has enhanced design completeness by performing continuous design and dimensional inspection. © 2021 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.

	abstract = {Background: Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a neuronal migration disorder and is a major cause of drug-resistant epilepsy. However, many focal abnormalities remain undetected during routine visual inspection, and many patients with histologically confirmed FCD have normal fluid-Attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR-negative) images. The aim of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the changes in cortical thickness with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of patients to identify FCD lesions from FLAIR-negative images. Methods: We first used the three-dimensional (3D) Laplace method to calculate the cortical thickness for individuals and obtained the cortical thickness mean image and cortical thickness standard deviation (SD) image based on all 32 healthy controls. Then, a cortical thickness extension map was computed by subtracting the cortical thickness mean image from the cortical thickness image of each patient and dividing the result by the cortical thickness SD image. Finally, clusters of voxels larger than three were defined as the FCD lesion area from the cortical thickness extension map. Results: The results showed that three of the four lesions that occurred in non-Temporal areas were detected in three patients, but the detection failed in three patients with lesions that occurred in the temporal area. The quantitative analysis of the detected lesions in voxel-wise on images revealed the following: specificity (99.78%), accuracy (99.76%), recall (67.45%), precision (20.42%), Dice coefficient (30.01%), Youden index (67.23%) and area under the curve (AUC) (83.62%). Conclusion: Our studies demonstrate an effective method to localize lesions in non-Temporal lobe regions. This novel method automatically detected FCD lesions using only FLAIR-negative images from patients and was based only on cortical thickness feature. The method is noninvasive and more effective than a visual analysis for helping doctors make a diagnosis. © 2020 The Author(s).},

The cross-correlation algorithm is used to calculate the time delay of the transmitted transverse wave at each scanning point. Finally, the location of the internal defect can be estimated by considering the thickness of the sample and the distance between the two maximum signal delay points in the left scanning and the right scanning.

During the high-speed inspection, a relative motion occurred between the pipeline inspection gauge (PIG) and the steel pipe wall will generate motion-induced eddy current (MIEC). There is a lack of research on analyzing the effect of MIEC on high-speed MFL inspection for thick-wall steel pipe. In this article, a three-dimensional (3D) finite-element method (FEM) simulations are conducted with an inspection speed range of 0 m/s to 8 m/s and a wall thickness range of 8 mm to 15 mm. Simulation results show that both high-speed inspection and thick-wall thickness will decrease the magnetization of steel pipe. It is observed that, at the speed of 8 m/s and the thickness of 15 mm, the magnetic field strength is lower than 2 kA/m and the steel pipe exits from the magnetic saturation zone, which causes the severe distortion of three-axis MFL signals, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is lower than 6 dB. A high-speed PIG is developed here for experiments to measure the three-axis MFL signals. The characteristics of simulated and measured MFL signals are found to be quite consistent. © 2019, © 2019 American Society for Nondestructive Testing.},

	abstract = {Ultrasonic transducers typically used for inspection such as wall thickness measurement are not suitable for high temperature applications and the inspections are more of a periodic and manual in nature instead of continuous. A waveguide based method combined with synthetic focusing image reconstruction has been proposed for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of the components operating in hostile environments and is sometimes too complex and inaccessible for manual inspection. This work follows to develop a waveguide based sensing method to implement a robust and accurate monitoring of surface back wall damage with moderate coverage range. Finite Element (FE) Analysis has been carried out to study the multi-modal behavior in waveguides of rectangular cross sectional geometry and to choose optimal mode(s) and geometry which are best suited for the application. Simulations based on 3D Elastodynamic and 2D Acoustic FE models has been taken to study and implement the reconstruction for different cases representing various levels of wall loss.

	abstract = {This paper presents a suggested approach for forensic investigation of bridge decks in which Ground penetrating radar (GPR) consisting of two antennas is used to assess the current conditions. The methodology was tested on a bridge deck in central Sicily. The acquired data were analyzed for identifying the asphalt overlay thickness, concrete cover depth and deck thickness and location of the rebar reinforcement. In the proposed approach for assessing bridge deck conditions the GPR survey was complemented with (i) a site investigation on layer thicknesses for calibration/verification purposes of the GPR response and (ii) a Terrestrial Laser Scanning system (TLS) to verify the bridge design slab curvature. The study shows that this methodology has significant merits on accurately assessing such bridge deck components when bridge design records are non-existing, and by using non-invasive methods such as laser scanning and GPR. The great advantage provided by the TLS technique is the possibility to obtain a 3D output model of the scanned element with the accuracy of the best topographic instruments in order to complement GPR data surveys for bridge inspection. © 2020.

	abstract = {Thin-walled structures are widely used in aerospace, offshore, civil, marine and other engineering industries. Buckling of such thin-walled imperfection sensitive structures is a very important phenomenon to be considered during their design phase. Existing design guidelines, being the most known the NASA SP-8007 for cylinders dated from the late 1960's are currently used in the aerospace industry and employ conservative lower-bound knock-down factors. These empirically based lower-bound methods do not include important mechanical properties of laminated composite materials, such as the stacking sequence. New design approaches that allow taking full advantage of composite materials are therefore required. This study deals with buckling experiments of axially compressed, unstiffened carbon fiber–reinforced polymer (CFRP) cylinders with and without an additional lateral load. Two geometrically identical cylinders with the same layup were designed, manufactured and tested. Before testing, the thickness of the cylinders was measured with ultrasonic inspection and the geometry was measured utilizing a 3D scanning system based on photogrammetry. During testing, a digital image correlation system was employed to monitor deformations, strain gage readings and load-shortening data was taken. Modelling of shape mid-surface and thickness imperfections as well as fiber volume fraction correction are included into the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of the test structures, and the experimental results are compared against FEA results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Coal is the most economical and reliable energy that can achieve clean and efficient use. The intelligent, safe, efficient development of coal resources and low-carbon clean utilization are the core technical support for achieving high-quality development of China' s coal industry. Based on the development requirements of the primary stage of coal mine intelligentization in China, the research and engineering construction of the coal mine intelligent technology system was carried out. The top-level design and research of intelligent coal mines were carried out, and the overall architecture of intelligent coal mines was divided into several layers including equipment layer, infrastructure layer, service layer and application layer based on the concept of "mine working as the platform", and a special high-speed transmission network was built in the mining area, and data format and communication agreements and standards were unified. A number of platforms and systems have been built, including big data cloud platform, coal mine intelligent center and integrated management system, coal mine safety strong real-time communication network and underground precise location service system, geological support and 4D-GIS dynamic information system, roadway intelligent rapid tunneling system, mining work surface intelligent cooperative control system, coal flow and auxiliary transportation and warehousing intelligent system, coal mine underground environment awareness and safety management and control system, coal cleaning and intelligent system, coal mine full station equipment and health intelligent management system, coal mine area and green ecological intelligence system, etc., to achieve intelligent closed-loop management of coal mine production, safety, ecology, and security. For the information island problem in intelligent coal mines, technical research on multi-source heterogeneous data modeling, feature extraction, and data mining was carried out. The data-driven information entity modeling and update technology used a bottom-up approach to extract the attributes, associated information and functional information of the monitoring data, and constructed the mapping relationship between different data information, and established a mining information sharing service platform, provided data services in different application scenarios underground. In view of the problem that the existing coal shearer' s memory cutting was difficult to adapt to the coal seam thickness and changes in various geological conditions, an intelligent coal mine high- precision three-dimensional geological model construction method was studied, and a coal seam thickness adaptive cutting control method based on the dynamic update of the geological model was proposed. A three-dimensional geological model of coal seam thickness was established through the coal seam geological information,which used the coal-rock interface information obtained during the shearing process of the coal shearer to modify the geological model in real time, and planned ahead the cutting path of the next coal cut in order to realize automatic cutting control of the shearer based on the self-adaptation of coal seam thickness. The intelligent design technology was developed for working face mining and connection. By constructing a GIS "one map" distributed collaborative integration platform based on a unified spatial database, the geological information, engineering information, and equipment information were unified into a " one map". The position coordinates of the continuous working face were entered in the geological model, the system automatically calculated the working face length, mining height, reserves and other related information, and based on the calculation results, it automatically selected the supporting design of the working face equipment and completed the various drawings and reports of the working face. The intelligent design of drawings, rules and specifications of the continuous working face were compiled and realized, which greatly reduced the repeated labor in the process of mining and excavation; the posture detection and navigation technology, automatic anchoring technology, automatic net laying technology, roadway 3D modeling and quality monitoring technology were studied, using laser target and inclination sensor combined navigation technology for directional navigation and self-correction of the roadheader; automatic mesh laying device was used with anchor drill rig to achieve roadway surrounding rock automatic bolt support; a laser scanning system was used to quickly scan and measure the roadway through the image stitching matching algorithm, to build a three-dimensional accurate model of the roadway, and achieve accurate monitoring of the quality of the roadway formation; through intelligent driving equipment and geology, the fusion of multi-source information such as spatial information was used to realize holographic perception and scene reproduction of the driving face; ultrasonic and laser combined ranging sensors were used to achieve a wide and accurate measurement of the relative position between the various equipment on the driving face, and the characteristics of ultrasonic measurement was used to determine the spatial relative motion mode of the associated equipment; the characteristics of high laser ranging accuracy was used to determine the precise location of the associated equipment, personnel identification sensors were used to perceive the personnel in the non-working area, and compiled through the operation process regulations and parameters between the equipment. The interlocking and coordinated control program of the complete equipment realized the coordinated linkage of the complete equipment for the excavation. The intelligent mining face featuring " manned patrol, unmanned operation" has been gradually promoted and applied throughout the country. The development and practice of shearer adaptive cutting technology based on the dynamic update of the three-dimensional geological model has been carried out in the middle of the shearer. A high-precision 3D gyroscope was used to monitor the position and posture of the shearer in real time, and combined the monitoring results with the aforementioned high-precision 3D geological model to determine the coordinate position of the shearer in the 3D geological model; The inspection robot was installed on the scraper conveyor, and a three-dimensional laser scanner was installed on the inspection robot to effectively merge the three-dimensional laser scanning data with the unit geological model data, the shearer posture data, and the shearer rocker cutting data. The real-time cutting curve of the shearer can be obtained, by comparing the actual shearing curve of the shearer with the geological model of the coal-rock layer interface curve, to achieve intelligent adjustment of the shearing height of the shearer. The coal and rock interface information was input into the 3D geological model, and the coal and rock interface information of 3 to 5 m in front of the working face was dynamically updated based on the difference algorithm, and good test results were obtained in some mining areas. The intelligent ventilation system was studied, and the parameters such as air volume, wind speed, gas and temperature at key points of the mine were monitored, and the technology of multi-source data coupling analysis, redundancy analysis, three-dimensional modeling, etc.which was used to perform real-time dynamic calculation of the mine ventilation network. The calculated data in real time was correlated to control related equipment such as mine main ventilator, local ventilator, air door, air window and so on. The paper analyzed the technical difficulties and solutions of the application of intelligent cleaning technology, intelligent auxiliary transportation technology, and 5G communication technology in coal mines, and systematically analyzed the key technical problems that restrict the construction of intelligent coal mines from the perspective of technology research and development. The paper elaborated in detail on the current stage achievements of large domestic coal production enterprises,such as Shendong Coal Group, Yankuang Group,Datong Coal Mine Group, Yangmei Coal Group, Zibo Mining Group, Xinwen Mining Group, etc. in the construction stage of intelligent coal mines. The combination of research and development and field practice analyzed the main technical problems and development directions in the process of intelligent coal mine construction. A study was carried outon the coal mine intelligent standard system, the framework of the coal mine intelligent standard system was put forward, and the "intelligent coal mine classification, classification of technical conditions and evaluation index system", "intelligent comprehensive mining face classification, classification evaluation technical conditions and index system" and other related standards were drafted, providing standard support for the high-quality development of intelligent coal mine construction. © Meitan Kexun Jishu/Coal Science and Technology (Peking) 2020.},

	abstract = {We present here the development and evaluation of a deep learning (artificial intelligence)-based computer vision machine to automate segmentation of multiclass progressive matrix damage across micro and mesoscales in aerospace-grade advanced composite laminates visualized in 4D via nondestructive in situ mechanical testing coupled with synchrotron radiation computed tomography (SRCT). Leveraging tens of thousands of manually-/human-annotated SRCT tomograms (i.e., 2D virtual cross-sectional slices) encompassing two different aerospace-grade advanced composite laminate systems (standard-thickness-ply and thin-ply) that were SRCT-scanned while under progressive tensile loading, we teach a fully convolutional neural network machine to segment complex polymer matrix damage mechanisms according to their host ply, replacing ~10 hours of trained human labor per scan segmentation (~2000 tomograms per scan) with negligible time to configure the trained machine data-processing pipeline. Evaluating qualitatively and quantitatively the segmented tomograms independently in 2D, as well as collectively in 3D scans, we demonstrate good agreement between the state-of-the-art human-based region growing (semi-manual) method and machine-based segmentation results, summarized by test set macro-averages of the following common classification/segmentation performance metrics: 79% for F1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) and 67% for intersection over union (IoU) score. Moreover, 2D inspection of segmented damage within tomograms reveals that F1 and IoU scores actually underrate machine performance due to a nontrivial degree of human (used as ground truth) segmentation error, as the machine is found to regularly exceed the human (resulting in F1 and IoU score penalties) by discovering new damage instances, augmenting existing diffuse segmentations, and extending segmentations to image artifact-prone specimen edges. Consequently, we discover that deep learning-based segmentation successfully and efficiently characterizes sparse (<<1% of scan volume), extremely complex 3D damage states within SRCT datasets, resolving an intractable computer vision challenge (as viewed through the lens of traditionally programmed automation) and establishing these high-throughput tools as promising candidates to accelerate understanding of basic structure-property relationships in traditional and next-generation advanced composite materials. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

	abstract = {This work focuses on the combination of two complementary non-destructive techniques to analyse the final deformation and internal damage induced in aramid composite plates subjected to ballistic impact. The first analysis device, a 3D scanner, allows digitalising the surface of the tested specimen. Comparing with the initial geometry, the permanent residual deformation (PBFD) can be obtained according to the impact characteristics. This is a significant parameter in armours and shielding design. The second inspection technique is based on computed tomography (CT). It allows analysing the internal state of the impacted sample, being able to detect possible delamination and fibre failure through the specimen thickness. The proposed methodology has been validated with two projectile geometries at different impact velocities, being the reaction force history on the specimen determined with piezoelectric sensors. Different loading states and induced damages were observed according to the projectile type and impact velocity. In order to validate the use of the 3D scanner, a correlation between impact velocity and damage induced in terms of permanent back face deformation has been realised for both projectiles studied. In addition, a comparison of the results obtained through this measurement method and those obtained in similar works, has been performed in the same range of impact energy. The results showed that CT is needed to analyse the internal damage of the aramid sample; however, this is a highly expensive and time-consuming method. The use of 3D scanner and piezoelectric sensors is perfectly complementary with CT and could be relevant to develop numerical models or design armours. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Aiming at the fold defects of engine gear shaft forgings tested by ultrasonic flaw detection, a research method combining physical experiment with finite element numerical simulation technology was proposed.The defective sample was cutted and the folding position and folding situation of the cut surface of the sample were observed. The causes of defect were analyzed according to the macroscopic shape and location of the folding, and the theoretical analysis was verified by Deform-3D finite element numerical simulation. According to the volume invariance principle in the metal plastic forming theory, the thickness of correlative preformed upper mold in the longitudinal and transverse directions of the toothed disc was optimized:the longitudinal thickness of the forging disc is reduced by a maximum of 2 mm, while the transverse thickness of the circular part is reduced by a maximum of 6 mm in positions with the largest size changes, ensuring that a 17 mm high mushroom head like structure can be added to eliminate the folding defect and guarantee the production of qualified forgings. For the improved mold structure, the rationality and reliability of the optimized mold structure were ensured by the second analysis of the forming process based on Deform-3D, and the qualified forging parts are ensured to be producted continuous and normally by pre-finish process under the premise of eliminating the defects. Finally, flaw detection and internal metal streamline inspection of the mass production forging parts were performed. ©2019, Editorial Board of Journal of Plasticity Engineering.

	abstract = {Corrosion and erosion on subsea installations is a big challenge for oil and gas operators and can carry significant cost and risk. Better monitoring of seabed installations will lower maintenance costs, provide greater control and reduce risk to installation integrity. For topside installations, there are several methods of inspection and monitoring available, but subsea, the challenge has been to find technology that works and provides real value. The growing number of aging subsea installations increases the need for good retrofit solutions. Research and development of guided-wave methods for asset monitoring and screening has been ongoing for several years and over this time ClampOn has developed a non-invasive instrument which can be used on new subsea installations or retrofitted by ROV to existing installations. While developing this guided wave based system, ClampOn's research team has worked in parallel to develop and implement more technology in the system which will provide high-resolution 3D data for the area being monitored. Tomography is already used elsewhere, such as in medical applications, but has never before been used as part of a fixed subsea system to monitor wall thickness loss in pipelines. Key learning outcome: ClampOn has developed a system that not only provides direct measurement of and important information about ongoing corrosion and erosion, but also offers highly accurate high-resolution 3D imaging of subsea pipes securing pipeline integrity. © 2018 SPE All rights reserved.},

Diverse data acquisition and processing approaches were considered depending on the type of the structure, geometric characteristics and surveying conditions. The first study case includes an underground reinforced concrete tunnel system with symmetric geometry, which is composed by a central corridor and lateral branches. For its documentation and characterization, three-dimensional imaging methodologies were applied to create a volumetric reconstruction of its whole underground network. Problems of moisture were also detected by the attenuation of the radar-wave signal, and finite-difference time-domain modelling was used as a supporting tool for data interpretation. After a deeper analysis of both field and synthetic data, and additional visual inspection, it was concluded that such portions of the structure, presenting this lack of information, are affected by corrosion in reinforcement. On the other hand, a GPR study was conducted through a bench excavation tunnel, in order to monitor quality control during the early stages of construction and to evaluate the tunnel stability. According to this benchmark, results provided noteworthy characteristics, namely: thickness of the shotcrete layer, lining damages and moisture problems. © 2015 IEEE.},

Besides conventional NDE&T lab methods such as eddy current test (ECT) for thickness measurement and fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI) for cracking detection, some latest NDE techniques have been developed, demonstrated and applied to evaluate and characterize thermal sprayed coatings recently. The improved and innovative NDE methods provide more capable and accurate measurement to inspect on surface morphology, 2D and 3D coating porosity, oxide content, interface debonding, as well as other types of coating features, defects or specific properties. In this work, some non-contact NDE techniques and their applications were investigated and discussed based on several case studies of thermal sprayed coatings. Laser confocal microscopy had been used for characterizing surface morphologies and roughness profiles of HVOF WC-based coatings with 2D and 3D mapping methods. In particular, thermal wave imaging and ultrasonic micro imaging methods were used to detect the suspicious existence of lateral coating separation within or at the MCrAlY coating-substrate interfaces.

	abstract = {In the wake of today's industrial revolution, many advanced technologies and techniques have been developed to address the complex challenges in well integrity evaluation. One of the most prominent innovations is the integration of physics-based data science for robust downhole measurements. This paper introduces a promising breakthrough in electromagnetism-based corrosion imaging using physics informed machine learning (PIML), tested and validated on the cross-sections of real metal casings/tubing with defects of various sizes, locations, and spacing. Unlike existing electromagnetism-based inspection tools, where only circumferential average metal thickness is measured, this research investigates the artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted interpretation of a unique arrangement of electromagnetic (EM) sensors. This facilitates the development of a novel solution for through-tubing corrosion imaging that enhances defect detection with pixel-level accuracy. The developed framework incorporates a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)-based EM forward solver and an artificial neural network (ANN), namely the long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN). The ANN is trained using the results generated from the FDTD solver, which simulates sensor readings for different scenarios of defects. The integration of the array EM-sensor responses and an ANN enabled generalizable and accurate measurements of metal loss percentage across various experimental defects. It also enabled the precise predictions of the defects' aperture sizes, numbers, and locations in 360-degree coverage. Results were plotted in customized 2D heat-maps for any desired cross-section of the test casings. Further analysis of different techniques demonstrated that the LSTM-RNN could show higher precision and robustness compared to regular dense NNs, especially in the case of multiple defects. The LSTM-RNN is validated using additional data from simulated and experimental data. The results show reliable predictions even with limited training data. The model accurately predicted defects of larger and smaller sizes that were intentionally excluded from the training data to demonstrate generalizability. This highlights a major advance toward corrosion imaging behind tubing. This novel technique paves the way for the use of similar concepts on other sensors in multiple barriers imaging. Further work includes improvement to the sensor package and ANNs by adding a third dimension to the imaging capabilities to produce 3D images of defects on casings. © 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers},

	abstract = {In the context of subterrain well inspection, it is important to efficiently and accurately evaluate the quality of the cement sheath that fills the annular region between the rock formation and the casing, which is a string of steel tubes. A continuously increasing number of such wells are being drilled in extreme environments requiring heavy, attenuative fluid filling the borehole for well stabilization, and larger and thicker casings for mechanical stability. Under those conditions, examining and ensuring the quality of the cement for safety reasons is of paramount importance. We have studied the limits of the most common ultrasonic pulse-echo-based technique for cement evaluation and corrosion detection. Its principle is based on the analysis of the resonance frequency and decay rate of an ultrasonic pulse reverberating in the casing. By analyzing the echo it extracts information about casing geometry and the acoustic impedance of the outer medium. Due to the specific geometrical requirements of the technique, the inhomogeneous, attenunative fluids and the thicker-walled casings pose increased demands on the processing approach. To overcome this problem we have developed a robust, calibration-free inversion algorithm based on a full 3D-model of the ultrasonic pulse-echo transducer which honors the physics of all interactions and the actual geometry. Unlike other methods, the here presented technique does not require the a priori knowledge of environmental parameters such as fluid properties, which are instead deduced from the measurement itself. The exponential decay of the received echo envelope depends on two parameters: the acoustic impedance of the fluid and that of the annulus both of which we find simultaneously by fitting the slope and the offset of the tail. In addition, the algorithm's optimization of performance time by several orders in magnitude allows usage of this processing in real time on a standard computer. Extensive laboratory studies and field testing have been carried out to support and validate the algorithm over an extended range of logging conditions, fluid types and a comprehensive set of casings with diameters up to 22 in. and wall thicknesses up to 1.25 in. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Underwater structure inspections are essential for infrastructure maintenance, such as hydraulic facilities, bridges, and ports. Due to the influence of turbidity, dark light, and distortion, the traditional methods cannot satisfy the requirements of on-site inspection applications. This paper proposed a methodology of the point cloud data capture in the turbid underwater environment. The method consisted of an acquisition device, a distortion correction algorithm, and a parameter optimization approach. The acquisition device was designed by composing a silt-removing module, a structured light camera module, and a clear water replacement module, which can integrate with an underwater inspection robot. The underwater multi-medium plane refraction distortion model was established through analysis, and a refraction correction algorithm was provided to correct the distortion. To obtain the maximum field of view of the point cloud, the nonlinear optimization approach was used to select the medium material and thickness. After the real experiments using the Intel RealSense sr300 depth camera, maximum measuring distance could range up to 253 mm in water, the accuracy of the point cloud of the underwater target objects was ±3.77 mm, and the maximum error was 8.76%. Compared with other methods, this method was more suitable for 3D point cloud capture in the turbidity environment.  © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

AM ultra-fine lattice structures are designed to mimic the operational intent of coated foams but with improved design flexibility, compressive strength, and flow behavior printed from into a single part directly from the preferred platinum metal alloy. The investigation objective was to conduct feasibility studies of AM ultra-fine lattice structures capable of replacing coated foams with superior functionality. NASA MSFC identified desired lattice characteristics and created designs while EOS developed optimized laser powder bed fusion AM parameters to manufacture Ti6Al4V and tungsten specimens. Optimized designs, computational tools, AM parameters, and post-process methods were developed.

	abstract = {The efficiency of eight algorithms of defect depth characterization (pulse phase thermography – PPT, thermographic signal reconstruction by analyzing the first and second derivatives– TSR, early observation – EO, apparent thermal inertia – ATI, thermal quadrupoles - TQ, non-linear fitting - NLF and neural networks – NN) has been comparatively analyzed on both theoretical and experimental IR image sequences obtained in the inspection of CFRP composite. Synthetic noise-free image sequences have been calculated by means of the ThermoCalc-3D software, while experimental results have been obtained by applying a one-sided procedure of pulsed thermal NDT to the inspection of artificial defects in CFRP. A relative error in the evaluation of defect depth has been chosen as a figure of merit. It has been demonstrated that a simple and robust processing technique is the use of the Fourier transform resulting in phase-domain data (PPT). The technique of TSR ensures maximal values of signal-to-noise ratio and is less susceptible to uneven heating and lateral heat diffusion. The calculation of ATI has allowed the characterization of defects at depths up to 1.5 mm, but it is sensitive to uneven heating thus requiring to carefully choose a non-defect area. The EO method, as well as the technique of TQ, have revealed inferior results in defect depth identification because of a noisy character of raw signals. Non-linear fitting is a convenient processing technique allowing simultaneous characterization of some test parameters, such as material thermal properties, defect depth and thickness, etc., but this technique is time-consuming and can hardly be applied to full-format images. In the whole defect depth range, minimal characterization errors have been ensured by the use of the NN that is a promising tool for automated identification of hidden defects. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Rise-Rover is our new generation robot, and it has a novel and enhanced absorption system to support heavy load, and crawler-like suction cups to maintain high mobility performance while crossing small grooves. Moreover, the design enables a seamless transition between ground and wall. This paper applies the fast Fourier transform and wavelet transform for feature detection from collected IE signals. A distance metric learning based support vector machine approach is newly proposed to automatically classify the IE signals. With the visual-inertial odometry of the robot, the detected flaws of inspection area on the concrete plates are visualized in 2D/3D.

The present paper reports initial results from tests where these techniques were applied to a pipeline specimen containing a plain longitudinal dented subjected to hydrostatic cyclic loading. Some of the material’s fatigue properties assessment used validated rapid approaches based on infrared thermography. The monitoring of fatigue initiation and propagation in the actual specimen used nondestructive infrared inspection techniques. Thermoelasticity stress analysis (TSA) and three-dimensional digital image correlation (3D-DIC) were used to determine fatigue hot spots locations as well as strain concentrations. Full field TSA and fiber optic Bragg strain gages (FBSG) were used to determine the overall stress field (TSA) as well hot spot strain evolution (FBSG) along the loading cycles. Strain fields determined from the experimental measurements and from finite element analysis (FEA) were combined with the fatigue Coffin-Manson model to predict fatigue life (Nc). The tested 3 m long tubular specimen was fabricated with API 5L Gr. B 12.75″ OD with ¼″ thickness pipes. The excellent agreement among test and predicted results achieved up to now are commented in the paper. © Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2020.},

	abstract = {Due to the well-known problem of 3He shortage, a series of different thermal neutron detectors alternative to helium tubes are being developed, with the goal to find valid candidates for detection systems for the future spallation neutron sources such as the European Spallation Source (ESS). A possible 3He-free detector candidate is a charged particle detector equipped with a three dimensional neutron converter cathode (3D-C). The 3D-C currently under development is composed by a series of alumina (Al2O3) lamellas coated by 1 μm of 10B enriched boron carbide (B4C). In order to obtain a good characterization in terms of detector efficiency and uniformity it is crucial to know the thickness, the uniformity and the atomic composition of the B4C neutron converter coating. In this work a non-destructive technique for the characterization of the lamellas that will compose the 3D-C was performed using neutron radiography. The results of these measurements show that the lamellas that will be used have coating uniformity suitable for detector applications. This technique (compared with SEM, EDX, ERDA, XPS) has the advantage of being global (i.e. non point-like) and non-destructive, thus it is suitable as a check method for mass production of the 3D-C elements. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab srl.},

	abstract = {Nowadays complex ceramic components are produced with high precision by Stereolithography. This method shows limitations when producing ceramic components having a wall thickness greater than approx. 10 ​mm. This is due to the amount of organic binder in the green bodies that, evacuating from the inner microstructure during the thermal debinding, brings to the formation of defects such as cracks and delaminations. To overcome this issue, the so-called “design for AM” approach can be exploited. In this work we replaced the inner body with a less voluminous porous architecture having a larger surface through which the decomposed binder can evacuate. Tubes filled with periodic architectures were 3D-printed using an Alumina-based photosensitive slurry. Several topology combinations were tested, by varying both the cell type and the struts diameter. The quality of the produced samples was analyzed through morphological inspections, while the mechanical properties (i.e. stresses and deformations) were assessed via FEM simulations. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Corrosion as common damage in civil, petrochemical, nuclear, and aerospace structures affects the integrity and safety of the structures and may lead to catastrophic failures. This paper presents dispersion curve regression-assisted local wavenumber analysis method, which can analyze the time–space wavefield containing wideband information of wave-damage interaction and further extract the structural information carried by such wavefield for characterizing hidden corrosion damage in an isotropic plate. To acquire the time–space wavefield, a noncontact scanning laser Doppler vibrometer is used. In our analysis method, the acquired time–space wavefield is firstly processed to generate a local wavenumber function. The derived wavenumber function is further analyzed with a dispersion curve regression step, which searches in a set of theoretical frequency-wavenumber dispersion curves for different plate thicknesses and identifies the optimal plate thickness whose theoretical curve best matches the frequency-wavenumber relation contained in the local wavenumber function. By this means, a 3D profile including both in plane and thickness dimensions of the structure can be constructed for corrosion visualization and quantification. The experimental study demonstrates that our method can quantify the profile of hidden uniform corrosion in metal plates in terms of its in-plane shape and size as well as its out-of-plane depth in the subwavelength scale. Moreover, compared to previous Lamb wave-based corrosion inspection methods, our technique allows for noncontact 3D characterization of hidden corrosion from a far distance to the structure. We believe this work will inspire new 3D damage quantification methods that are based on wavefield analysis as well as enable potential applications for the quantification of hidden corrosion in civil, petrochemical, nuclear, and aerospace structures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: There is a potential for direct model manufacturing of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) using 3D printing technique for generating flexible semi-transparent prototypes. A patient-specific AAA model was manufactured using fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printing technology. A flexible, semi-transparent thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), called Cheetah Water (produced by Ninjatek, USA), was used as the flexible, transparent material for model manufacture with a hydrophilic support structure 3D printed with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Printing parameters were investigated to evaluate their effect on 3D–printing precision and transparency of the final model. ISO standard tear resistance tests were carried out on Ninjatek Cheetah specimens for a comparison of tear strength with silicone rubbers. Results: It was found that an increase in printing speed decreased printing accuracy, whilst using an infill percentage of 100% and printing nozzle temperature of 255 °C produced the most transparent results. The model had fair transparency, allowing external inspection of model inserts such as stent grafts, and good flexibility with an overall discrepancy between CAD and physical model average wall thicknesses of 0.05 mm (2.5% thicker than the CAD model). The tear resistance test found Ninjatek Cheetah TPU to have an average tear resistance of 83 kN/m, higher than any of the silicone rubbers used in previous AAA model manufacture. The model had lower cost (4.50 GBP per model), shorter manufacturing time (25 h 3 min) and an acceptable level of accuracy (2.61% error) compared to other methods. Conclusions: It was concluded that the model would be of use in endovascular aneurysm repair planning and education, particularly for practicing placement of hooked or barbed stents, due to the model’s balance of flexibility, transparency, robustness and cost-effectiveness. © 2018, The Author(s).},

Parts of space launcher transport systems are one example for the application of conical shells. Buckling of such thin-walled imperfection sensitive structures is a very important phenomenon to be considered during their design phase. Nowadays, the analysts still use empirically based lower-bound methods such as the NASA SP-8007 for cylinders and SP-8019 for cones to calculate the required knock-down factors (KDFs), which do not include important mechanical properties of laminated composite materials, such as the stacking sequence. New design approaches that allow taking full advantage of composite materials are therefore required.The study deals with the buckling experiments on axially compressed, unstiffened carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) truncated cones performed by DLR for validation of high-fidelity numerical models. Three geometrically identical cones with different layup were designed, manufactured and tested. Before testing, the thickness of the cones was measured with ultrasonic inspection and the geometry was measured utilizing a 3D scanning system based on photogrammetry. During testing, a digital image correlation system was employed to monitor deformations, strain gage readings and load-shortening data were taken. Modeling of shape mid-surface, thickness and ply piece imperfections are included into the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of the test structures, and the experimental results are compared with the FEA results. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

In contrast to available rigorous and approximate methods, the present approach does not require cumbersome calculations; it is a clearly arranged method, which ensures sufficient accuracy for engineering applications. It is found that the fundamental diffraction parameter for 3D objects of constant thickness d is the critical diffraction angle θcr=λ/d at which the effect of three-dimensionality on the spectrum of the 3D object becomes appreciable. Calculated Fraunhofer diffraction patterns (spectra) and images of constant-thickness 3D objects with absolutely absorbing, absolutely reflecting, and gray internal faces are presented.

	abstract = {With the development of CMOS Si node shrinking from 65 nm to 32 nm, 28 nm to 14nm, the number of I/O of chips increases dramatically and the space of interconnection bumps becomes smaller and smaller. Fine pitch copper bump technology is more and more widely used in advanced flip chip package. When the pitch between bumps is less than 40um, the conventional mass reflow soldering can no longer meet the accuracy requirement of flip chip mounting. In addition, the warpage of ultra-thin die changes obviously during the reflow process in the process of 3D chip stacking. Thermal Compression Bonding (TCB) process can overcome the above two problems very well. TCB technology fixes the chip in the mounting position by bonding head, and heats the chip in place quickly, so that the bump joint can be formed rapidly, which overcomes the problems of chip misplacement & warpage in the mass reflow process. At present, TCB technology has been widely used in 3D chip stacking. At present, the mainstream HBM packaging adopts via middle TSV process. In the chip assembly, the front side of the DRAM wafer is attached with NCF film through the vacuum film laminator, and then the wafer is sent to dicing. Subsequently, the Thermal Compression Bonding (TCB) process is used to sequentially realize the flip-chip assembly between the multilayer DRAM chips and the logic chip. The main processes involved in HBM assembly also include wafer level molding, molding layer backside grinding, RDL and bumping processes on the backside of logic chip after wafer molding, etc. Based on the technical requirement of 3D multi-layer chip stacking, we design the test vehicle with four layers of 60um thickness chip, in which the top die is a single side bumping chip. In addition to the top layer chip, three layers of bottom chips adopt double-side bumping structure with 10um diameter TSV vertical interconnection. In the chip area of 5x5mm, there are 1158 micro-bumps. The minimum pitch between bumps is 40um and the clearance height after stacking is less than 20um. In this study, Non Conductive Film (NCF) is used in TCB process. NCF is a substitute material for traditional liquid Non Conductive Paste (NCP). The same as NCP, NCF is also a kind of thermosetting material. It warps the bump at high temperature and becomes solid when it cools down to room temperature. At the end of the process, NCF fills the gap and protects the bump. There are several technical difficulties in TCB-NCF process development, including NCF film vacuum lamination, multi-layer chip stacking, TCB bonding parameter adjustment and etc. In this study, 100% bump joint interconnection in die stacking is achieved by optimizing TCB parameters. Meanwhile, NCF can fully fill the gap between chips and pass C-SAM inspection. NCF thickness is optimized to ensure the minimum bleeding out. After the bottom chip is bonded to the silicon bare die by TCB-NCF method, the fully oven cure of NCF material is arranged, and then the stacking of the subsequent three chips is completed with the same process flow. TCB-NCF assembly process for C2W (Chip to Wafer) stacking is developed successfully. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Electrode manufacturing is one of the most critical processes within the energy storage production chain, as the electrodes coating and drying quality determines the later performance of the energy storage system in large part. Critical quality losses within the electrode coating are often optical visible, but cannot be automatically and inline inspected. Often small defects like agglomerates, capillary cracks or pinholes in the carbon or metal oxide based layers have to be detected at high web speeds. In the work described in this paper it was examined which kind of features and defects can be recognized by two optical methods: visual inspection and 3D measuring. A visual camera in conjunction with a white illumination and a 3D data laser line system has been used. Image processing algorithms are applied on the scanned data to detect pinholes and agglomerates. Also thickness of coating, gradient of the coating edge and form anomalies can be determined out of the produced data. Reliable evaluation of pinholes even of small sizes has been proofed. Particle agglomerations are more challenging. To achieve good enough data for 3D evaluation standard sensors are often insufficient, due to the necessary resolution and the production speed that requires high scanning frequency. In order to provide an automated, digitalized production and inspection system, the devices were coupled to a central experiment management system. Their operation is controlled non-locally in the cloud and synchronized with the execution of experiments. The acquired raw data is stored for later evaluation and long-term archiving. © SPIE.

An objective function for optimizing the process planning parameters is proposed in which perimetral offsets for each layer are considered as a parameter in addition to the layer thickness. The root-mean-square (RMS) value of the deviations between the NURBS representation of the CAD model and its built-up simulation is suggested to estimate a quantitative measure for the uncertainties. The proposed approach eliminates the sophistication of the calculation cusp volume in 3D space and has more compatibility with the corresponding inspection processes. The developed methodology is introduced based on using a metaheuristic algorithm to find the optimal layer thicknesses and perimetral offsets for a built-up model. A data collecting approach is also introduced to reduce the computation time associated with the simulation of the build-up model at each iteration.

	abstract = {Slowly but surely, more and more automated thermography measurement is being applied in industry. Thermography provides a high sensitivity for most defects, high accuracy in locating defects and mostly used in reflection mode, which is important for complex and large aerospace components. Furthermore, due to focal plane array detector, a large area can be measured comparatively in much less time than ultrasound inspection. By measuring components (< 6 mm thickness) with thermography the load of water coupled ultrasonic machine can be relieved. Recently, for the first time FACC [2] has qualified thermography inspection method for CFRP components and has reduced the inspection time up to 50 %, although measurement is conducted manually. Already in 2012 [1], DLR Augsburg carried out the automated thermography measurement of an aircraft structure and published the results. Since then, both the automated measurement process and the evaluation process have been continuously improved. To reduce the evaluation process time by means of 3D visualisation model for a large number of 2D thermography images, 2 independent methods [3] are developed at DLR. A further development of the evaluation process for both methods occurred first by generating a 3D-thermo-tomography model [4] (Measurement results according to their thermal depth). The defect analysis with this generated model takes place directly in the CAD environment. Along with their development phase accuracy of system components for two methods were analysed [5] within the scope of those respective test series. Moreover, experiments were performed for complete evaluation (the absolute and relative system accuracy between two methods), and 3D thermography models were generated with both methods to analyse visualisation accuracy of 3D model in CAD environment.

	abstract = {Abstract In today's society, the customer driven markets has led to the rapid developments and continuous evolution of manufacturing technologies. The ability to accurately produce complex parts, and to reuse and remanufacture used parts is becoming more prevalent, requiring more efficient and rapid methods to be developed. One such method being currently developed is the hybrid process combining additive, subtractive and inspection processes for the manufacture of complex part geometries from any given raw material in terms of shape and size. A major element of the hybrid process is decomposition of a part into a number of subparts, which are additively manufactured and machined in sequence. However, the residual stresses resulting from the temperature difference between the solidified material (i.e. already manufactured subparts) and the material being deposited (i.e. new subparts being built) leads to part distortions, which significantly reduces the dimensional accuracy of finished parts. This study investigates part distortions that take place in the additive manufacturing process under the context of hybrid manufacturing. A method for conducting this investigation was first proposed. A mathematical model was developed, identifying the influential parameters that contribute to part distortions. These parameters were then incorporated in the experimental design by employing the Taguchi design of experiments strategy. Distortion behaviour arising from thermally induced stress was experimentally explored, indicating that part length, height, and layer thickness have significant effects on part distortions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

The measurements have complex response characteristics, which must be understood to optimize measurement design and data processing choices. Until recently, the industry lacked an adequate first principles description of sensitivity to defect penetration and size, including the foundational cases of circular and elliptical defects. An inversion method has been developed and validated with independent synthetic and lab data. The data was obtained using an analytical forward model, finite element modeling, and laboratory data from different thickness and diameter pipes with known machined defects of different sizes and penetrations. The approach enables inverting field data to reconstruct 3D defect profiles, which helps to assess casing health and offers valuable information to the decision-maker for well integrity.

	abstract = {PIGs (pipeline inspection gauges) have been the main equipment for pigging, inner inspecting operations in oil and gas pipelines. Due to the insurmountable shortcomings of conventional sealing discs, it is impossible to actively control the PIG when it is running on the pipeline, which leads to no way when the PIG is stuck. In this study, a new type of bio-inspired sealing disc was designed in combination with the webbed foot structure of animals (e.g., bird, frog, duck), soft robot technology and the conventional sealing disc, adding a new way to the mechanical pigging method. And the 3D printing technology was used to print the sample of the bio-inspired sealing disc, taking into account the new direction of manufacturing the PIG. Then, effects of the interference (δ), clamping rate (ζ), webbed foot thickness (tw) and the number of webbed foot (N) of the bio-inspired sealing disc on the contact force and stress were studied using MSC Marc 2016 when the PIG was in pipe. The simulation results show that the contact force and stress on the bio-inspired sealing disc are not uniform, showing a great difference in the uniform contact force and stress on the conventional sealing disc. The effect of interference and clamping rate on the maximum contact force, stress on the bio-inspired sealing disc and the influence on the conventional sealing disc are basically the same, but the impact on the minimum stress and contact force is different. The thickness of the webbed foot has the greatest influence on the contact force, stress on the bio-inspired sealing disc, and the number of the foot has the least influence. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In this study, a simple thickness evaluation method was proposed for corroded roadlighting poles based on thickness measurement results of a dismantled road-lighting pole which had been used for about 40 years. The remaining thickness in cross-section of this specimen was measured by using both of Ultrasonic Thickness Gauge (UTG) and 3D portable laser scanner in order to investigate the accuracy of average thickness which could be obtained from only 4 measuring points at intervals of 90 degrees in circular cross-section. In this UTG measurement, the smoothing process, which will be carried out ordinarily by using electric grinder around measuring points, was abbreviated from the considering of labor-saving and additional thickness loss. From the measurement results, UTG measurement under the condition of no smoothing process will overestimate the actual remaining average thickness depending on surface roughness due to corrosion. Finally, an example of simple thickness evaluation, which uses average thickness and standard deviation based on only four measuring points, was shown for more reasonable UTG inspection of corroded road-lighting poles.

	abstract = {Background and Objective Artificial skin phantoms have been developed as an alternative tissue for human skin experiments due to convenient use and easy storage. However, fabricating both thin (∼100 μm) epidermis and relatively thick dermis is often cumbersome, and most developed phantoms have hardly reflected specific human skin types. The objective of this study was to fabricate skin phantoms with 3D printing technique to emulate various human skin types (I-VI) along with the corresponding optical and mechanical properties for laser tattoo removal. Study Design/Materials and Methods Both gelatin and agar powders were mixed with coffee and TiO2 particles to fabricate skin phantoms with materials properties for various skin types (I-VI). A 3D printer was employed to precisely control the thickness of each phantom for epidermis and dermis layers. A number of concentrations of the coffee and TiO2 particles were used to determine the degree of absorption and scattering effects in various skin types. The optical properties between 500 and 1,000 nm for the fabricated phantoms were measured by double-integrating spheres with an inverse adding-doubling (IAD) algorithm. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and rheometer were also utilized to evaluate optical (absorption and reduced scattering coefficients) and mechanical properties (compression modulus) of the fabricated phantoms, respectively. Results Visible color inspections presented that the skin phantoms for types I, III, and VI similarly emulated the color space of the human skin types. The optical property measurements demonstrated that the absorption (μa) and reduced scattering (μs′) coefficients decreased with wavelengths. Compared to the human skin type VI, a dermis phantom represented quite equivalent values of μa and μs′ whereas an epidermis phantom showed up to 30% lower μa but almost identical μs′ over the wavelengths. The OCT measurements confirmed that the thicknesses of the epidermis and the dermis phantoms were measured to be 138.50 ± 0.01 μm and 0.81 ± 0.04 mm, respectively. The mechanical properties of the phantoms mixed with the agar volume of 40% yielded a compression modulus of 83.7 ± 14.8 kPa, which well corresponded to that of human forearm skin (50-95 kPa). Conclusion The 3D printing technique was able to reliably fabricate the double-layered phantoms emulating a variety of skin types (I-VI) along with the comparable optical and mechanical properties. Further investigations will incorporate artificial chromophores into the fabricated skin phantoms to reliably evaluate the new therapeutic wavelengths for laser tattoo removal. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {This work presents a method of characterising pipeline defects using a small number of radiographs taken at different angles around the pipe. The method relies on knowledge of the setup geometry and use of multiple images, and does not require calibration objects to be included in the setup. It is aimed at use in situations where access is difficult such as in subsea pipeline inspections. Given a set of radiographs, a background subtraction method is used to extract defects in the images. Using a ray tracing algorithm and knowledge of the experimental setup, the range of possible locations of the defect in 3D space is then calculated. Constraints are applied on potential defect shapes and positions to further refine the defect range. The method is tested on simulated and experimental flat bottomed hole defects and simulated corrosion patch defects with lateral and axial sizes ranging from 12.5 to 33.8 mm and thickness between 3 mm and 16 mm. Results demonstrate a good, consistent ability to calculate lateral and axial defect dimensions to within ±3 mm of the true size. Defect thickness calculations are more difficult and as such errors are more significant. In most cases defect thickness is calculated to within 4 mm of the actual value, often closer. Errors in thickness are due to overestimation, meaning the calculation could be used to place a maximum limit on potential defect size rather than as an actual estimate of the thickness. This would still be useful, for example in deciding whether a defect requires further investigation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Establishing the exact mineralogical composition of stone beads and the precise methods used to manufacture beads are key to documenting shifts in these systems, but so far visual inspection has served as the primary mode of analysis for most assemblages. Here, we apply XRD and 3D digital optical microscopy to investigate raw material selection and bead manufacture at the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) settlement of el-Hemmeh, Jordan. Analyses reveal that PPNA bead assemblages emphasize the color green but included a wide variety of mineral types. The LPPNB assemblage exhibits a greater diversity in shape and color, including an emphasis on the use of red minerals, but consist of a more restricted range of minerals and lack the rectangular beads found in the PPNA. Color rather than suitability of material properties for bead making appears to have motivated choices for mineral selection. Bidirectional perforation was codified into the technological system and was consistently used to produce beads during the PPNA regardless of their size, thickness, or hardness. © 2018},

	abstract = {One of the great strengths of X-ray computed tomography over conventional inspection methods (ultrasound, thermography, radiography) is that it can image damage in 3D. However for curved or deformed composite panels it can be difficult to automatically ascribe the damage to specific plies or inter-ply interfaces. An X-ray computed tomography (CT) data processing methodology is developed to extract the through-thickness distribution of damage in curved or deformed composite panels. The method is applied to [(0°/90°)2]s carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) panels subjected low velocity impact damage (5 J up to 20 J) providing 3D ply-by-ply damage visualisation and analysis. Our distance transform approach allows slices to be taken that approximately follow the composite curvature allowing the impact damage to be separated, visualised and quantified in 3D on a ply-by-ply basis. In this way the interply delaminations have been mapped, showing characteristic peanut shaped delaminations with the major axis oriented with the fibres in the ply below the interface. This registry to the profile of the panel constitutes a significant improvement in our ability to characterise impact damage in composite laminates and extract relevant measurements from X-ray CT datasets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Cubic samples of hybrid Ni/Al open-cell foam with an edge length of 15 mm were investigated by the DECT measurement. The material was prepared using AlSi7Mg0.3 aluminium foam with a mean pore size of 0.85 mm, coated with nanocrystalline nickel (crystallite size of approx. 50 nm) to form a surface layer with a theoretical thickness of 0.075 mm. CT imaging was carried out using state-of-the-art DSCT/DECT X-ray scanner developed at Centre of Excellence Telč. The device consists of a modular orthogonal assembly of two tube-detector imaging pairs, with an independent geometry setting and shared rotational stage mounted on a complex 16-axis CNC positioning system to enable unprecedented measurement variability for highly-detailed tomographical measurements. A sample of the metal foam was simultaneously irradiated using an XWT-240-SE reflection type X-ray tube and an XWT-160-TCHR transmission type X-ray tube. An enhanced dual-source sampling strategy was used for data acquisition. X-ray images were taken using XRD1622 large area GOS scintillator flat panel detectors with an active area of 410 x 410 mm and resolution 2048 x 2048 pixels. Tomographic scanning was performed in 1,200 projections with a 0.3 degree angular step to improve the accuracy of the generated models due to the very complex microstructure and high attenuation of the investigated material. Reconstructed data was processed using a dual-energy algorithm, and was used for the development of a 3D model and voxel model of the foam. The selected parameters of the models were compared with nominal parameters of the actual foam and showed good correlation. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab srl.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore the application of computer-aided design and rapid prototyping (CAD/RP) for removable partial denture (RPD) frameworks and evaluate the fitness of the technique for clinical application. Materials and Methods: Three-dimensional (3D) images of dentition defects were obtained using a lab scanner. The RPD frameworks were designed using commercial dental software and manufactured using selective laser melting (SLM). A total of 15 cases of RPD prostheses were selected, wherein each patient received two types of RPD frameworks, prepared by CAD/RP and investment casting. Primary evaluation of the CAD/RP framework was performed by visual inspection. The gap between the occlusal rest and the relevant rest seat was then replaced using silicone, and the specimens were observed and measured. Paired t test was used to compare the average thickness and distributed thickness between the CAD/RP and investment casting frameworks. Analysis of variance test was used to compare the difference in thickness among different zones. Results: The RPD framework was designed and directly manufactured using the SLM technique. CAD/ RP frameworks may meet the clinical requirements with satisfactory retention and stability and no undesired rotation. Although the average gap between the occlusal rest and the corresponding rest seat of the CAD/RP frameworks was slightly larger than that of the investment casting frameworks (P < .05), it was acceptable for clinical application. Conclusion: RPD frameworks can be designed and fabricated directly using digital techniques with acceptable results in clinical application. © 2017 by Quintessence Publishing Co Inc.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Computed tomography scanning of the lumbar spine incurs a radiation dose ranging from 3.5 mSv to 19.5 mSv as well as relevant costs and is commonly necessary for spinal neuronavigation. Mitigation of the need for treatment-planning CT scans in the presence of MRI facilitated by MRI-based synthetic CT (sCT) would revolutionize navigated lumbar spine surgery. The authors aim to demonstrate, as a proof of concept, the capability of deep learning–based generation of sCT scans from MRI of the lumbar spine in 3 cases and to evaluate the potential of sCT for surgical planning. METHODS Synthetic CT reconstructions were made using a prototype version of the “BoneMRI” software. This deep learning–based image synthesis method relies on a convolutional neural network trained on paired MRI-CT data. A specific but generally available 4-minute 3D radiofrequency-spoiled T1-weighted multiple gradient echo MRI sequence was supplemented to a 1.5T lumbar spine MRI acquisition protocol. RESULTS In the 3 presented cases, the prototype sCT method allowed voxel-wise radiodensity estimation from MRI, resulting in qualitatively adequate CT images of the lumbar spine based on visual inspection. Normal as well as pathological structures were reliably visualized. In the first case, in which a spiral CT scan was available as a control, a volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) of 12.9 mGy could thus have been avoided. Pedicle screw trajectories and screw thickness were estimable based on sCT findings. CONCLUSIONS The evaluated prototype BoneMRI method enables generation of sCT scans from MRI images with only minor changes in the acquisition protocol, with a potential to reduce workflow complexity, radiation exposure, and costs. The quality of the generated CT scans was adequate based on visual inspection and could potentially be used for surgical planning, intraoperative neuronavigation, or for diagnostic purposes in an adjunctive manner. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2020.10.FOCUS20801 © 2021. except where prohibited by US copyright law.

The main objective is to match measurement point data to its nominal representation, so as to identify form defects. Since form defects have the same size order as the thickness of the part, establishing such matching is a challenging task. The originality of the method developed in this paper is using a deformable iterative closet point algorithm (ICP), and integrating modal approach to express form defects. The method described improves the matching through iteration of the ICP and establishes a definition of the error.

	abstract = {3D scanning technology uses lasers to scan and capture object surfaces without physical surface contact. Laser scanning is gaining acceptance by many, including owners of marine or offshore assets as a viable inspection and validation method. Laser technology reduces operational times compared to traditional pit gauging techniques, particularly for large areas of widespread wastage or pitting. This paper studies the use of 3D scanning technology for inspection, thickness gauging, and steel wastage measurements of hull structures. Pilot tests were conducted on coated and uncorroded plates in Houston, USA, and uncoated and corroded plates and uncoated and deformed plates in Perth, Australia. Manual Ultrasonic Testing (UT) was conducted, which is the method currently accepted by International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) for thickness measurements of hull structures. For the coated plate, the coating thickness was measured on both sides of the plate. The coating thickness was deducted from the total thickness from 3D scanning before the plate thickness was compared with the UT results. Acceptance criteria are proposed to compare the Manual UT measurements with the 3D scanning measurements to determine if 3D laser scanning is a possible alternative thickness measurement method. The difference of thickness measurements from 3D scanning on coated and uncorroded plates is within 13% when compared with those from UT. The discrepancy is attributed to equipment accuracy tolerances, errors from data post-processing, and measurement errors due to coating surface roughness. For uncoated and corroded plates, the difference reduces to 3%, making the results of 3D scanning acceptable based on acceptance criteria. In addition, the higher accuracy of using 3D scanning to measure plate deformation is demonstrated over traditional methods which use stringlines or laser levels to create a reference surface. Comparisons of the coefficient of variation (CV) on all plates demonstrate the higher precision of 3D scanning technology than that of manual UT. The main limitation of 3D laser scanners is their inability to directly obtain steel thickness for structures that have been coated or painted, especially in watertight/oil-tight structures. The study identifies capabilities, accuracy, and limitations of using 3D scanning technology for thickness measurements of hull structures in the marine or offshore industries. Scanning technology can support inspections providing fast and precise means of thickness measurements of corroded plates without coating. It provides the potential for producing 3D models and analysis for follow-up inspections. Plausible use cases in the maritime industry include defect analysis, fitness for service assessment, damage assessment, and corrosion monitoring. © 2021 by ASME},

One of the major concerns during layup process is the accidental occurrence of inclusions like release film, pre-preg backup film etc., Presently, inclusions are detected through visual inspection by clean room inspector. As these inclusions are very thin, they may go unnoticed by the inspector. These inclusions can cause delamination or disbonds during the service life of an aircraft leading to the rejection of component resulting in loss of time and money. This raises requirement for a semi-automated/automated system to detect inclusion in a faster, efficient and reliable manner during layup process.

	abstract = {The blades are an important part of gas turbines and internal defects, such as cracks and holes, can occur in some gas turbine blades. Due to the harsh working environment, these defects have a great influence on the safe operation of the gas turbine in practical applications. In this paper, a new method based on a digital radiography (DR) system is adopted to detect defects in gas turbine blades. Considering the limited size of the flat-panel detector in a DR system and the uneven thickness distribution of the irregular-shaped gas turbine blades, a region segmentation-based inspection method is presented in this paper. That is, the gas turbine blade is divided into a few regions using lead wires and the DR system is then used to inspect these sub-regions. Considering the high cost and low eficiency limitations of high-power computed tomography (CT) and traditional film-based radiographic testing (RT), certain image processing methods are adopted to accurately automate the extraction and analysis processes. A cubic polynomial interpolation background subtraction method is adopted for the accurate extraction of defects. In addition, a finite element method is presented to obtain the 3D parameter (the volume) of a defect from its 2D radiographic image. Experimental results show that the proposed method can eficiently estimate the 2D and 3D geometric parameters of defects in gas turbine blades at a low cost. The method is particularly suitable for offline X-ray inspection of gas turbine blades.},

	abstract = {For the inspection of large diameter pipes, particularly wastewater and stormwater systems, closed-circuit television (CCTV) is the commonly chosen inspection method. However, the long-term management of critical pipe infrastructure requires intelligent decisions made with detailed and quantitative data that CCTV cannot provide. With newly developed multisensor inspection (MSI) technologies, it is now possible to quantify the shape and size of pipes, and defects within them, in three dimensions (3D). Advancements in MSI methods allow for measurement of remaining wall thickness, detection of voids developing outside the pipe, and the creation of 3D digital point clouds with millimeter accuracy. By using these quantifiable measurements, a more accurate assessment of large water, wastewater, and stormwater pipes can be obtained, allowing the pipeline owner to accurately estimate remaining service life via these predictive models. Advancements in MSI technologies are highlighted in this paper, including 3D LiDAR, sonar, and pipe penetrating radar (PPR), and how to combine these technologies to collect comprehensive, quantitative data from large diameter pipes. Benefits of the technology will be demonstrated by recent case studies. The owner of a large, critical, and irregularly shaped sewer tunnel in Denver, Colorado, needed accurate dimensions in order to undertake the needed rehabilitation. The 7,580 ft long tunnel was inspected using multiple LiDAR devices, sonar, and a high-definition 360-degree CCTV camera deployed on a custom-built long-range inspection platform. This combination of sensors provided a detailed, accurate, and comprehensive report that was critical for an effective rehabilitation plan. The second case study illustrates how Melbourne, Australia, used a robotic, multisensor crawler to inspect critical sewer lines in the 23.5 to 37.5-in. range. These reinforced concrete pipes were inspected with pipe penetrating radar, LiDAR, and high-definition CCTV camera in order to design an effective asset management plan. The effectiveness, adaptability, and affordability of the described technologies allow asset managers to obtain comprehensive and actionable data that in turn are essential for effective asset management.  © 2021 ASCE.},

	abstract = {Reliable and quantitative non-destructive evaluation for small fatigue cracks, in particular those in hard-to-inspect locations, is a challenging problem. Guided waves are advantageous for structural health monitoring due to their slow geometrical decay of amplitude with propagating distance, which is ideal for rapid wide-area inspection. This paper presents a 3D laser vibrometry experimental and finite element analysis of the interaction between an edge-guided wave and a small through-thickness hidden edge crack on a racecourse shaped hole that occurs, in practice, as a fuel vent hole. A piezoelectric transducer is bonded on the straight edge of the hole to generate the incident wave. The excitation signal consists of a 5.5 cycle Hann-windowed tone burst of centre frequency 220 kHz, which is below the cut-off frequency for the first order Lamb wave modes (SH1). Two-dimensional fast Fourier transformation (2D FFT) is applied to the incident and scattered wave field along radial lines emanating from the crack mouth, so as to identify the wave modes and determine their angular variation and amplitude. It is shown experimentally and computationally that mid-plane symmetric edge waves can travel around the hole's edge to detect a hidden crack. Furthermore, the scattered wave field due to a small crack length, a, (compared to the wavelength l of the incident wave) is shown to be equivalent to a point source consisting of a particular combination of body-force doublets. It is found that the amplitude of the scattered field increases quadratically as a function of a/λ, whereas the scattered wave pattern is independent of crack length for small cracks a < < l. This study of the forward scattering problem from a known crack size provides a useful guide for the inverse problem of hidden crack detection and sizing. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {We describe an improved version of spectrally resolved white-light interferometry that enables us to measure thin film thickness profile in a faster and more reliable way. Both the interferometric phase and the spectral reflectance of thin films are monitored at the same time in order to obtain accurate thickness and top surface height of thin films, leading to the complete reconstruction of the 3D tomographic profile of thin films. To do that, information related to the layers of thin films and top surface height of thin films must be decoupled and, based on wavelet transform, allowing it to be achieved without introducing two troublesome measurement steps or spectral carrier frequency. The experimental results for a prepared specimen showed that thin film thickness profile could be determined within an error range of 9 nm compared to well-known techniques. Due to the rigorous approach used in the proposed method, it is well suited for the in-line high-speed inspection of microelectronic devices produced in large quantities as is done in the semiconductor and flat-panel display industries. © 2018, Korean Society for Precision Engineering and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {With the growth of 3D packaging technology and the development of flexible, transparent electrodes, the use of multilayer thin-films is steadily increasing throughout high-tech industries including semiconductor, flat panel display, and solar photovoltaic industries. Also, this in turn leads to an increase in industrial demands for inspection of internal analysis. However, there still remain many technical limitations to overcome for measurement of the internal structure of the specimen without damage. In this paper, we propose an innovative optical inspection technique for simultaneous measurements of the surface and film thickness corresponding to each layer of multilayer film structures by computing the phase and reflectance over a wide range of wavelengths. For verification of our proposed method, the sample specimen of multilayer films was fabricated via photolithography process, and the surface profile and film thickness of each layer were measured by two different techniques of a stylus profilometer and an ellipsometer, respectively. Comparison results shows that our proposed technique enables simultaneous measurements of the top surface and its underlying film surfaces with high precision, which could not be measured by conventional non-destructive methods. © The Author(s) 2017.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) semiconductor devices can address the limitations of traditional two-dimensional (2D) devices by expanding the integration space in the vertical direction. A 3D NOT-AND (NAND) flash memory device is presently the most commercially successful 3D semiconductor device. It vertically stacks more than 100 semiconductor material layers to provide more storage capacity and better energy efficiency than 2D NAND flash memory devices. In the manufacturing of 3D NAND, accurate characterisation of layer-by-layer thickness is critical to prevent the production of defective devices due to non-uniformly deposited layers. To date, electron microscopes have been used in production facilities to characterise multilayer semiconductor devices by imaging cross-sections of samples. However, this approach is not suitable for total inspection because of the wafer-cutting procedure. Here, we propose a non-destructive method for thickness characterisation of multilayer semiconductor devices using optical spectral measurements and machine learning. For > 200-layer oxide/nitride multilayer stacks, we show that each layer thickness can be non-destructively determined with an average of approximately 1.6 Å root-mean-square error. We also develop outlier detection models that can correctly classify normal and outlier devices. This is an important step towards the total inspection of ultra-high-density 3D NAND flash memory devices. It is expected to have a significant impact on the manufacturing of various multilayer and 3D devices. © The Author(s) 2021.},

Conventionally, methods such as micro computed tomography or scanning electron microscopy imaging have been applied to the measurement of geometric properties of porous material; however, high costs and low speeds make them unsuitable for analysing high volumes of components. Recent advances in the image-based analysis of open cell structures have opened up the possibility of qualifying variation in manufacturing of porous material. Here, a photogrammetric method of measurement, employing image analysis to extract values for geometric properties, is used to investigate the variation between identically designed porous samples measuring changes in material thickness and pore size, both intra- and inter-build. Following the measurement of 125 samples, intra-build material thickness showed variation of ±12%, and pore size ±4% of the mean measured values across five builds. Inter-build material thickness and pore size showed mean ranges higher than those of intra-build, ±16% and ±6% of the mean material thickness and pore size, respectively. Acquired measurements created baseline variation values and demonstrated techniques suitable for tracking build deviation and inspecting additively manufactured porous structures to indicate unwanted process fluctuations. © IMechE 2016.},

The exploitation of the results obtained makes it possible to carry out preventive maintenance to eliminate the hazards before a critical threshold of the dimensions of the hidden rust is reached.

	abstract = {Historically tools for determining the remaining thickness of metal within a well have suffered from some technical limitations. Tools indicating thickness by measuring magnetic properties have largely relied on permanent magnets; this has required tools to be matched to casing size and has limited their ability to pass through restrictions. Tools based on ultrasonic measurements are limited by the presence of gas, as the absence of a liquid phase does not provide sufficient energy coupling for signal transmission and detection. However, new developments in electromagnetic casing inspection technologies have resulted in a slim tool with multiple sensors that is capable of passing through restrictions and, while operating in several casing sizes, will operate in a wide range of well fluids. The tool generates an alternating magnetic field that travels outside the pipe being inspected. An array of twelve sensors detects localised information about the magnetic wave within the metal and this is used to generate a quantified log of remaining metal as well as used to provide 3D images of the casing thickness. Unlike other magnetic methods gradual thinning of the metal can be seen. The tool can be run with internal inspection methods such as multi-finger calipers to provide a total assessment of the condition of a well. © 2004, held jointly by the Society of Petrophysicists and Well Log Analysts (SPWLA) and the submitting authors.},

Due to the fact that destructive methods are not suitable for historical buildings of great architectural significance, a non-destructive method based on electrical tomography has been adopted. A hybrid tomograph with special sensors was developed for the measurements. This device enables the acquisition of data, which are then reconstructed by appropriately developed methods enabling spatial analysis of wet buildings. Special electrodes that ensure good contact with the surface of porous building materials such as bricks and cement were introduced. During the research, a group of algorithms enabling supervised machine learning was analyzed. They have been used in the process of converting input electrical values into conductance depicted by the output image pixels. The conductance values of individual pixels of the output vector made it possible to obtain images of the interior of building walls as both flat intersections (2D) and spatial (3D) images. The presented group of algorithms has a high application value. The main advantages of the new methods are: high accuracy of imaging, low costs, high processing speed, ease of application to walls of various thickness and irregular surface. By comparing the results of tomographic reconstructions, the most efficient algorithms were identified. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {In this study, we aimed to verify the accuracy of models created with the help of open-source Slicer 3.6.3 software (Surgical Planning Lab, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA) and the Mcor Matrix 300 paper-based 3D printer. Our study focused on the accuracy of recreating the walls of the right orbit of a cadaveric skull. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) of the skull was performed (0.25-mm pixel size, 0.5-mm slice thickness). Acquired DICOM data were imported into Slicer 3.6.3 software, where segmentation was performed. A virtual model was created and saved as an.STL file and imported into Netfabb Studio professional 4.9.5 software. Three different virtual models were created by cutting the original file along three different planes (coronal, sagittal, and axial). All models were printed with a Selective Deposition Lamination Technology Matrix 300 3D printer using 80 gsm A4 paper. The models were printed so that their cutting plane was parallel to the paper sheets creating the model. Each model (coronal, sagittal, and axial) consisted of three separate parts (∼200 sheets of paper each) that were glued together to form a final model. The skull and created models were scanned with a three-dimensional (3D) optical scanner (Breuckmann smart SCAN) and were saved as.STL files. Comparisons of the orbital walls of the skull, the virtual model, and each of the three paper models were carried out with GOM Inspect 7.5SR1 software. Deviations measured between the models analysed were presented in the form of a colour-labelled map and covered with an evenly distributed network of points automatically generated by the software. An average of 804.43 ± 19.39 points for each measurement was created. Differences measured in each point were exported as a.csv file. The results were statistically analysed using Statistica 10, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. The average number of points created on models for each measurement was 804.43 ± 19.39; however, deviation in some of the generated points could not be calculated, and those points were excluded from further calculations. From 94% to 99% of the measured absolute deviations were <1 mm. The mean absolute deviation between the skull and virtual model was 0.15 ± 0.11 mm, between the virtual and printed models was 0.15 ± 0.12 mm, and between the skull and printed models was 0.24 ± 0.21 mm. Using the optical scanner and specialized inspection software for measurements of accuracy of the created parts is recommended, as it allows one not only to measure 2-dimensional distances between anatomical points but also to perform more clinically suitable comparisons of whole surfaces. However, it requires specialized software and a very accurate scanner in order to be useful. Threshold-based, manually corrected segmentation of orbital walls performed with 3D Slicer software is accurate enough to be used for creating a virtual model of the orbit. The accuracy of the paper-based Mcor Matrix 300 3D printer is comparable to those of other commonly used 3-dimensional printers and allows one to create precise anatomical models for clinical use. The method of dividing the model into smaller parts and sticking them together seems to be quite accurate, although we recommend it only for creating small, solid models with as few parts as possible to minimize shift associated with gluing. © 2015 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.},

This study discusses the type of welding used in the industry, mainly involving the pipeline welds. On-demand need to every work process when finishing weld requires quality tests to ensure compliance to the standards required. Monitoring through the display image has long been used in Non-Destructive Testing (NDT). Various methods of monitoring used in NDT focused on Ultrasonic Tomography (UT) as a method used in NDT and as an option for the future. Previous imaging result was in two-dimensional (2D) and then upgraded to a three-dimensional image (3D). Besides, there is potential of 3D imaging beyond the existing limits in terms of size, material thickness, especially for welding steel pipes. Achievement through research of existing pipe size so far outside diameter of 200 mm and a thickness of 5.8 mm should be limited in view of the obstacles to enhanced image resolution is less effective when compared to other tomography methods. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press.

	abstract = {Purpose The aim of this study was to compare a developmental optical coherence tomography (OCT) based contact lens inspection instrument to a widely used geometric inspection instrument (Optimec JCF), to establish the capability of a market focused OCT system. Methods Measurements of 27 soft spherical contact lenses were made using the Optimec JCF and a new OCT based instrument, the Optimec is830. Twelve of the lenses analysed were specially commissioned from a traditional hydrogel (Contamac GM Advance 49%) and 12 from a silicone hydrogel (Contamac Definitive 65), each set with a range of back optic zone radius (BOZR) and centre thickness (CT) values. Three commercial lenses were also measured; CooperVision MyDay (Stenfilcon A) in −10D, −3D and +6D powers. Two measurements of BOZR, CT and total diameter were made for each lens in temperature controlled saline on both instruments. Results The results showed that the is830 and JCF measurements were comparable, but that the is830 had a better repeatability coefficient for BOZR (0.065 mm compared to 0.151 mm) and CT (0.008 mm compared to 0.027 mm). Both instruments had similar results for total diameter (0.041 mm compared to 0.044 mm). Conclusions The OCT based instrument assessed in this study is able to match and improve on the JCF instrument for the measurement of total diameter, back optic zone radius and centre thickness for soft contact lenses in temperature controlled saline. © 2016 British Contact Lens Association},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) scanning processes have been applied to a wide range of manufacturing industries for inspection and reverse engineering. Especially, optical scanning method is used mostly as a non-contact scanning technique in manufacturing field. However, it can be influenced from surface characteristics such as transparency and reflectivity. To resolve these problems, various coating techniques have been studied for years. Among them, atomization-based coating method is one of the key technologies to change its characteristics before scanning the objects. In this study, atomization-based spray coating system is developed for producing a uniform thin layer. Then, a series of experiments are conducted to evaluate the coating performance with the developed coating system. As a result, after coating the surface of transparent and shiny target objects: glass slide, colour sample, cell cover, and clutch lever, 3D scanning results show that a uniform coating of target objects is significantly improved. Its coating thickness is less than 1 μm which means that it is important to keep the geometry unchanged of the part. Copyright © The Korean Society for Precision Engineering.},

	abstract = {The knowledge of local conditions in a PWR reactor core at high temperature and pressure are important for the optimization of the fuel assembly reliability. In particular it is of interest to distinguish between the effects of the local temperature distribution, the effects of the local concentration of the moderator's chemical or structural components and the effects of the cladding material property variations to better interpret inspection results of fuel assemblies and to improve conclusions for design optimization. Since local parameters cannot be measured during operation, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is the method of choice to calculate the local fuel rod conditions. For example, the movement of discrete, virtual particles in the moderator can today already be simulated by a Lagrangian model with the particle tracking approach for CRUD deposition simulation. The development of a reference 3D PWR corrosion and CRUD deposition model was started which can calculate local parameters on a fuel rod surface to predict oxide thickness and component deposition taking into account the mixing effects during the moderator transport. The calculated 2D surface coolant temperatures were coupled to a dedicated fuel rod corrosion model, covering the full fuel rod in azimuthal and axial direction. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The presidential palace of India was constructed between the years 1912 to 1929 CE in a novel architectural style resulting from an amalgamation of Colonial and traditional Indian styles. During a visual inspection of this double-domed structure, meridional cracks were spotted in two out of the four niches in the drum of the lower dome. The observed distress raised two important issues that needed to be resolved- the cause of the cracks and their impact on the structural response. The uncertainty in the actual geometry of the building and the variety of materials used in its construction, the complex layout, lack of prior knowledge of reinforcement details and the undocumented changes made to the structure prompted the adoption of a multi-disciplinary scientific investigation to evaluate the structure. The methodical approach encompassed a literature review of dome failures in the past, historical and geometrical surveys, foundation inspection and the use of relevant non-destructive and minor destructive tests in the evaluation of the superstructure. The information gained from the aforementioned investigation was useful in the development of a 3D finite element model of the structure. The findings of the investigation revealed that owing to its geometry, tensile stresses develop in the unreinforced brick masonry drum. The reduction in the thickness of the drum at the locations of the niches results in an inherent weakness in the structure. The opening for the stairwell in the north-eastern corner of the building, at the level of the drum, further reduces the tensile resistance of the abutment system of the dome and gives rise to the observed crack pattern © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Using optical 3D digitisation for dimensional and shape inspection of work-pieces became a trend recently. Before a 3D scanning process starts, surface of the measured part must usually be coated with a thin layer of anti-reflective material. Such surface coating can be performed by means of a wide range of products with various composition and application method. It is however important to know how the matt coating affects the quality and accuracy of digitization, what the structure and thickness of a coating are. The thickness of a coating may vary significantly from product to product and according to our research, it ranges between units and hundreds of µm. This article presents results of an extensive research of seven matt coating products commonly used in practice. The measurement was carried out on cylindrical and spherical elements using ATOS optical 3D scanner and an electron microscope. Thereafter, the measurement results were analysed to define how the applied coating product along with the material of measured object affect the work-piece dimensional properties. The ease of coating removal was evaluated in the research as well. © 2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

Three dimensional finite element (3D-FE) modeling has been performed to optimize the magnetizing unit and inter-coil spacing of bobbin coils used for axial magnetization of the tube. The performance of the technique has been evaluated experimentally by measuring the axial (Ba) component of the leakage fields from localized machined defects in SG tubes. The MFL technique has shown capability to detect and image tube outside defects with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) better than 6 dB. Study reveals that Inconel support plates surrounding the SG tubes do not influence the MFL signals. As the MFL technique can detect localized defects in the presence of support plates as well as sodium and the remote field eddy current technique is sensitive to distributed wall thinning, their combined use will ensure comprehensive inspection of the SG tubes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present design guideline and simulation results of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) embedded field effect transistor (FET) for high frequency mode operation. The CMUT-FET consists of a mechanical CMUT part and an electrical sensing FET part. The device has a characteristic of a shared gate dielectric between a CMUT and an FET; hence, the gate capacitance change in the CMUT part can be reflected to the FET current as pressure changes. With an FET's current amplifying characteristic, the CMUT-FET makes it possible to achieve higher sensitivity and high resonant frequency with smaller element pitch and smaller active cell area than existing CMUTs. Combination of a 3-D finite element analysis (FEA) model of the CMUT part and a commercial technology computer aided design (TCAD) simulation of the FET device was used for inspection of the CMUT-FET device performance. In the 3-D FEA simulation, we focused on investigating pull-in voltage and electrical potential of a rectangular CMUT plate which have 20MHz resonant frequency in immersion with different dimensions. The FET part simulation was performed with variation of gate oxide thickness, source/drain doping concentration, channel doping concentration, substrate doping concentration. We combined data and inspected overall device performance with pressure variation at specific gate voltage and optimized the factor above-mentioned to get high sensitivity. Simulation results show that the optimized model has the collapse voltage of 13.4V and the pressure sensitivity of 11.34μA/Pa at gate voltage of 11V. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Holographic tomography (HT) enables nondestructive, quantitative measurement of three-dimensional refractive index distribution of transparent, weakly-scattering micro-samples. The method has been successfully applied for inspection of technical objects, as well as biomedical specimens. The key element of the HT measurement is acquisition of multiple holograms corresponding to various projection directions. In the conventional configuration of HT, this is achieved by rotating a sample, which provides high and almost isotropic resolution of tomographic imaging. However, the major disadvantages of this configuration is degradation of the reconstruction quality due to inaccuracies of the sample rotation. In this paper, we propose a novel autofocusing solution, which enables compensation of the rotation errors in HT. The method utilizes cross-analysis of two optical fields that were registered for special combination of the illumination and rotation angles. The proper selection of these parameters ensures redundancy of information in the fields, which here is used for quantitative evaluation of the misalignment error. Notably, the proposed solution is fundamentally different than other alignment methods for HT. Those methods utilize autofocusing algorithms that assume a single in-focus plane of a sample. Contrarily, our solution does not disregard the 3D character of a sample and thus is compatible with tomographic measurements. The utility of the proposed alignment method is validated with numerical simulations using two examples of complex samples with large axial thickness: A set of beads and Shepp-Logan phantom. © 2018 SPIE.},

	abstract = {In this study, near-surface cracks in a railhead are inspected thoroughly using phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT). This research finds an alternative technique to inspect for near-surface cracks because the conventional non-destructive testing method for rail inspection lacks the capacity to inspect the near-surface crack profile. This study shows that PAUT can determine not only the crack depth but also the near-surface crack profile, so that the inspector can estimate the stage of crack growth and how the crack propagates. This information is valuable to the rail maintainer as one of the considerations for deciding the thickness of metal to remove when grinding the rail. In this study, after the measurement, the inspected region of the cracked railhead is sliced into thin pieces so that crack network information can be extracted. A 3D image reconstruction of the surface cracks based on the crack marks from all of the sliced rail pieces is performed. This image is then used as a reference to confirm the PAUT results. The results show that PAUT can clearly deliver crack profile estimation and provide an accurate estimation of a 3.51 mm crack-tip depth with an absolute error range of 8%-18%. The results also suggest that PAUT is a potential method for installation in a measurement train for near-surface crack inspection. © 2020 British Institute of Non-Destructive Testing.

	abstract = {Cement evaluation results are commonly presented in a standard two-dimensional (2D depth and azimuth vs. bond) log format, whereas casing inspection results may include three-dimensional (3D depth and azimuth with projected radius vs. thickness) images. The incorporation of 3D images supporting cement evaluation provides an enhanced visualization-based interpretation capability and improved decision making. The incorporation time-based surveillance monitoring (4D) with current casing evaluation techniques provides pipe integrity inspection solutions to operators that expands capabilities beyond current industry norms. Ultrasonic-based casing inspection and existing post-processing software creates multiple images, curves, spreadsheets, and statistics designed to pinpoint areas of casing damage. In addition, high-resolution passes could be made to create 3D images of the casing geometry, including portions with damage. Applying the same 3D imaging technique to cement evaluation enables increased comprehension of the cement sheath characteristics, particularly extending away from the immediate casing wall-cement contact. An analysis method was developed to evaluate the behavior of standard cement bond log (CBL) refracted waveforms and is applied directionally to the multiple waveforms from the segmented bond tools. This process enables a detailed interpretation of the entire cement sheath between the casing and formation. It is possible to detect channels or problem areas in the annular space with this new process. Building on these processing results, it is possible to create 3D images, along with cross-sectional views, that enable easy visualization of the annular volume. The results of the processing and resulting images help to illuminate inferior cement sheaths that do not provide the desired zonal isolation and help to determine the reasons for the unwanted fluid production. When managing riser inspection or monitoring casing wear, it is important to scrutinize changes in the pipe condition over time to meet governmental regulations. Visually comparing the logging runs is the standard legacy methodology, but this is extremely time-consuming, particularly when comparing large amounts of data. This paper demonstrates a new technique to observe these alterations of the pipe conditions over time, both on a depth-by-depth and joint-by-joint basis. This new 4D surveillance interpretation method, accepted by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), enables the operator to complete pipe inspections quickly and to continue drilling with confidence.

	abstract = {The complexity of historic constructions, with irregular geometry, inhomogeneous materials, variable morphology, alterations and damages, poses numerous challenges in the digital modeling and simulation of structural performances under different types of actions. Although recent developments in Building Information Modeling have introduced advanced simulation capabilities, the numerical characterization of historic buildings is still a challenging task for the lack of reliable procedures for structural simulation. This paper presents an innovative two-step methodology (Cloud-to-BIM-to-FEM) able to convert a historic BIM into a finite element model for structural simulation. The generation of the BIM (Cloud-to-BIM) is carried out with an accurate survey that integrates geometrical aspects, diagnostic analysis based on destructive and non-destructive inspections, material information, element interconnections, and architectural and structural considerations. The BIM is then turned into a finite element model (BIM-to-FEM) with a geometric rationalization which preserves irregularities and anomalies, such as verticality deviation and variable thickness. After setting material properties, loads, and boundary conditions, the structural simulation is run with a detailed model that respects the uniqueness and authenticity of the historic building, without the typical excessive geometric simplifications of the shape. A real case study is illustrated and discussed to prove that a rigorous Cloud-to-BIM-to-FEM workflow allows the generation of an accurate historic BIM from a set of laser scanning point clouds. Structural simulation was carried out with a 3D mesh derived from the BIM in order to take into consideration the geometrical irregularity of a castle. Here, the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach are illustrated and discussed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The integrity of reactor pressure vessel (RPV) is greatly affected by pressurized thermal shock (PTS). Once crack appears in the nozzle region, the stress concentration around the crack tips may lead to crack propagation, and finally cause a serious security problem. When the transient temperature is above the nil-ductility reference temperature, elastic–plastic constitutive relations are considered in the fracture mechanics analysis. The temperature-related properties of the materials are introduced into a 3-D finite element model to establish the temperature field and stress field of a real RPV. Since the test and safety inspection for RPV with defects under PTS loads are quite difficult and dangerous, the process of the ductile crack propagation is simulated by the extended finite element method (XFEM), and the critical crack sizes for different base wall thicknesses are determined. Then, the quantitative analysis of the effect of the crack position on the ultimate bearing capacity is carried out. For the crack tips with different shapes, the crack propagation law and the shape effect on the ultimate bearing capacity of the whole structure are also analyzed. According to their crack propagation paths and damage degrees, a good agreement is obtained. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper presents two turbomachinery-specific methods for profile tolerance assessment of compressor airfoils that process 3D scan data. This optical inspection technology digitizes the entire surface of the part into a triangulated mesh, which is aligned to nominal geometry and then processed to extract densely arranged profile sections. For the reverse engineering method, the profile sections are decomposed into thickness and camber distributions. These distributions and the camber line are used to identify the profile parameter vector of the reverse engineering model. The deviation of the actual geometry is obtained by subtracting its parameters from those of the nominal geometry. Parameter-span graphs reveal airfoil shape deviation and allow for quantification of blisk scatter. The design-like parameters are meaningful and enable an intuitive engineering judgement of the actual geometry deviation. The profile tolerance assessment method utilizes the camber line from the reverse engineering method to elegantly check against variable profile tolerance limits. The actual section is best-fitted to its nominal counterpart and assessed regarding its deviation relative to the allowed local tolerance. This ratio is plotted in a developed view summarizing the result of the profile tolerance assessment for the whole airfoil in a single graph. Thus, the condensed results allow for effective utilization of the high-resolution in airfoil sections. Ultimately, the paper widens the view from one airfoil towards the assessment of the entire blisk. The blisk data is presented by statistical processing of deviation fields of all airfoils, in terms of mean and standard deviation. These statistical quantities are plotted onto the airfoil contour to e.g. represent the average airfoil thickness of the blisk. The standard deviation plot points to airfoil sections of larger geometric scatter and reveals areas of a non-robust manufacturing process. Copyright © 2020 ASME.},

	abstract = {Casings can deform over the life of the well due to various reasons such as changing stress regimes, geological fault and fractures causing pinching, pressure differential created due to production, increased pressure due to injection, squeezing formations such as shale and salt, etc. A detailed casing deformation evaluation can provide insights to the operators in correlating the deformation to suitable reasons in their field. There are various methods to evaluate the innermost casing or tubing using ultrasonic and mechanical caliper measurements but there is no technology available to evaluate outer or second casing deformation without first retrieving the inner casing or tubing. This work introduces and encapsulates the novel methodology of transforming the outer or second casing third interface echo (TIE) response, obtained by advanced ultrasonic and flexural measurement inside innermost casing or tubing, into a 3D wellbore view to suitably visualize and analyze the outer or second string deformations. The work involves measuring the azimuthal radius and thickness of the innermost casing with the ultrasonic evaluation technique and computing the azimuthal annular distance between the two casings using the flexural wave TIE arrival time and its velocity in the annular fluid. The computed values are then combined to generate an array of azimuthal internal radius values of the outer or second casing and is finally converted into a 3D wellbore image for better and straight-forward visualization. To validate the methodology, a shop inspection test (SIT) was carried out where the dimensions of the inner and the outer casing were precisely measured with a mechanical caliper tool. Following that, ultrasonic and flexural measurement tool was run inside the innermost casing to obtain the response of both casings. The comparison showed a close match between the actual values and the measurements. Also, the 3D wellbore shape clearly showed the geometry of the outer string validating the methodology used in the creation of the 3D shape. The work can enable the operators to carry out time lapse outer string analysis on a periodic basis to give them early indications of any deformation in the outer or second string. This novel technique or methodology also has valuable application in plug and abandonment (P&A) where the inner tubing and casing retrieval can be hindered due to outer casing deformation. This technique can also help in designing the right drilling BHA for sidetracking based on the minimum ID of the outer pipe through which slot recovery or side-track has to be performed. © 2021, Offshore Technology Conference.

The two notches had a root radius of 0.45 mm, which imposes a multiaxial stress state and a state of high triaxiality in the net (minimal) section of the specimens. Tests were carried out until the failure occurred from one of the notches. The other one, unbroken but deformed under steady strain rate or steady load, was inspected using the Synchrotron Radiation Computed Tomography (SRCT) technique. These 3D through thickness inspections allowed the study of microstructural evolution at the peak stress for the monotonic tensile test and at the beginning of the tertiary creep for the creep tests. Cavitation features were assessed with a micrometre resolution within the notched region. Spatial distributions of void volume fraction (Vf) and void morphology were studied. Voiding mechanisms were similar under steady strain rates and steady loads. The maximum values of Vf were located between the axis of revolution of the specimens and the notch surface and voids were considered as flat cylinders with a circular basis perpendicular to the loading direction. A model, based on porous plasticity, was used to simulate the mechanical response of this PA6 material under high stress triaxiality. Both macroscopic behaviour (loading curves) and voiding micro-mechanisms (radial distributions of void volume fraction) were accurately predicted using finite element simulations. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Increased outsourcing of Integrated Circuit (IC) design and fabrication combined with malicious hardware security threats such as contactless optical probing have greatly decreased an attacker's difficulty in reverse engineering or maliciously modifying a given circuit. This has become a significant concern for the safety and security of the semiconductor industry. Physical inspection techniques have been used to validate the IC hardware integrity and detect security threats to address these concerns. However, most physical inspection methods for ICs rely upon removing unwanted epoxy packaging material without damaging the device under test (DUT). Therefore, the precise removal of the IC packaging guided by knowledge of the packaging structure is very important for efficiency and accuracy in this process. Currently, IC structure analysis depends on using high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT), which is time-consuming and lacks the spatial resolution necessary for characterizing advanced heterogeneous packages. For hardware assurance purposes, the entire volume of a device must be analyzed with high efficacy. Additionally, various packaging and the recently adopted 2.5D and 3D advanced packages bring more challenges to meet assurance requirements. Hybrid metrology, which is the combined use of inspection methods for characterization, has the potential to address the inspection challenges for advanced packaging. In this paper, a novel hybridized inspection method utilizing nondestructive THz time-domain spectrum (THz-TDS) and X-ray CT of the IC package is used to create a digital twin (DT) of the sample. The combined characterization can be leveraged to improve the efficiency and accuracy for high quality sample preparation. Hybrid inspection paired with automated sample preparation can reduce the time and operator input needed for complete verification of a large volume of samples. In this paper, the method of generating a digital twin of the IC internal regions of interest (ROI) will be introduced. Analysis of the generated digital twin is used to optimize the material removal necessary for IC verification without damaging the ROI. This inspection and removal methodology can be automated using boundary conditions from the design information of the IC package. Hybrid inspection provides the high spatial resolution thickness and geometry information for generating an automated material removal routine. This provides access to the sample's ROI for further FIB plasma delayering and SEM verification.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to introduce a novel method for the analysis of open cell porous components fabricated by laser-based powder bed metal additive manufacturing (AM) for the purpose of quality control. This method uses photogrammetric analysis, the extraction of geometric information from an image through the use of algorithms. By applying this technique to porous AM components, a rapid, low-cost inspection of geometric properties such as material thickness and pore size is achieved. Such measurements take on greater importance, as the production of porous additive manufactured orthopaedic devices increases in number, causing other, slower and more expensive methods of analysis to become impractical. Design/methodology/approach: Here the development of the photogrammetric method is discussed and compared to standard techniques including scanning electron microscopy, micro computed tomography scanning and the recently developed focus variation (FV) imaging. The system is also validated against test graticules and simple wire geometries of known size, prior to the more complex orthopaedic structures. Findings: The photogrammetric method shows an ability to analyse the variability in build fidelity of AM porous structures for use in inspection purposes to compare component properties. While measured values for material thickness and pore size differed from those of other techniques, the new photogrammetric technique demonstrated a low deviation when repeating measurements, and was able to analyse components at a much faster rate and lower cost than the competing systems, with less requirement for specific expertise or training. Originality/value: The advantages demonstrated by the image-based technique described indicate the system to be suitable for implementation as a means of in-line process control for quality and inspection applications, particularly for high-volume production where existing methods would be impractical. © 2018, Samuel Evans, Eric Jones, Peter Fox, Chris Sutcliffe.},

	abstract = {Acardiac twinning is a rare anomaly of monochorionic twin pregnancies. Acardiac fetuses lack a functional heart but are passively perfused by arterial blood from their pump co-twin causing the acardiac body to be hypoxemic. In this report, we present an acardius anceps, therapeutically laser separated from its pump twin at 16 weeks. The healthy pump twin and macerated acardiac body were born at 40 3/7 weeks. A three dimensional (3D) reconstruction was made by CT images, showing cranial bones, spinal column, pelvis and lower extremities but absent arms. A cyst in the neck of the acardiac twin was identified by postnatal sonography; this was also described in four literature cases, and was additionally observed by us in two other acardiac twins. Median cleft palate was identified by oral cavity inspection but undetectable in the reconstruction. In the literature, we found 21 other acardiac anceps twins with a cleft palate. From the two larger published series, with 12 clefts in 21 acardiac anceps twins, a cleft palate occurs in over 50% during acardiac twinning. Our first hypothesis is that acardiac fetuses develop an oral cleft palate when acardiac onset starts prior to 11 weeks, because 11 weeks includes the period of embryonic oral cavity formation, and no cleft occurs when onset starts later than 11 weeks. Our second hypothesis is that cysts and cleft palates are more common in acardiac twins than currently known, likely reflecting that acardiac bodies are hypoxemic and that hypoxia contributes to the development of both cysts and clefts. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Purpose: In this study, we developed a 3D-printed deformable pelvis phantom for evaluating spatial DIR accuracy. We then evaluated the spatial DIR accuracies of various DIR settings for cervical cancer. Methods: A deformable female pelvis phantom was created based on patient CT data using 3D printing. To create the deformable uterus phantom, we first 3D printed both a model of uterus and a model of the internal cavities of the vagina and uterus. We then made a mold using the 3D printed uterus phantom. Finally, urethane was poured into the mold with the model of the internal cavities in place, creating the deformable uterus phantom with a cavity into which an applicator could be inserted. To create the deformable bladder phantom, we first 3D printed models of the bladder and of the same bladder scaled down by 2 mm. We then made a mold using the larger bladder model. Finally, silicone was poured into the mold with the smaller bladder model in place to create the deformable bladder phantom with a wall thickness of 2 mm. To emulate the anatomical bladder, water was poured into the created bladder. We acquired phantom image without applicator for EBRT. Then, we inserted the applicator into the phantom to simulate BT. In this situation, we scanned the phantom again to obtain the phantom image for BT. We performed DIR using the two phantom images in two cases: Case A, with full bladder (170 ml) in both EBRT and BT images; and Case B with full bladder in the BT image and half-full bladder (100 ml) in the EBRT image. DIR was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) and 31 landmarks for the uterus and 25 landmarks for the bladder. A hybrid intensity and structure DIR algorithm implemented in RayStation with four DIR settings was evaluated. Results: On visual inspection, reasonable agreement in shape of the uterus between the phantom and patient CT images was observed for both EBRT and BT, although some regional disagreements in shape of the bladder and rectum were apparent. The created phantom could reproduce the actual patient's uterus deformation by the applicator. For both Case A and B, large variation was seen in landmark error among the four DIR parameters. In addition, although DSCs were comparable, moderate differences in landmark error existed between the two different DIR parameters selected from the four DIR parameters (i.e., DSC = 0.96, landmark error = 13.2 ± 5.7 mm vs. DSC = 0.97, landmark error = 9.7 ± 4.0 mm). This result suggests that landmark error evaluation might thus be more effective than DSC for evaluating DIR accuracy. Conclusions: Our developed phantom enabled the evaluation of spatial DIR accuracy for the female pelvic region for the first time. Although the DSCs are high, the spatial errors can still be significant and our developed phantom facilitates their quantification. Our results showed that optimization is needed to identify suitable DIR settings. For determining suitable DIR settings, our method of evaluating spatial DIR accuracy using the 3D-printed phantom may prove helpful. © 2017 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

	abstract = {Failure analysis is crucial in improving semiconductor manufacturing yields. Yield improvement is done by collecting, analyzing, identifying the causes of defects, and applying corrective actions to resolve the root causes. With the ongoing miniaturization of TSVs, micro-bumps, RDLs, and other package interconnects [1], detecting defects in these buried interconnects is becoming more difficult as well as more important. Traditionally semiconductor packages are cross-sectioned to identify internal process defects such as unsolders, solder shorts, and pad misalignment. Cross-sectioning is a destructive approach, is difficult to do, and provides information in a single 2D plane only. Due to the large effort and the destructive nature of this approach, the amount of data that can be generated is typically quite limited. The development of 3D X-ray microscopy provides industry with the capability to image and analyze buried features such as micro-bumps, TSVs, and other metallic structures using a non-destructive, 3-dimensional technology [2]. At the same time, deep learning has revolutionized other technologies such as visual surveillance, predictive maintenance [3], object detection [4], and is now revolutionizing defect detection in semiconductors. When used together, the combination of 3D X-ray microscopy and deep learning is establishing a new paradigm in package inspection and metrology. In this paper, we will present a novel method for automatically detecting internal anomalies in semiconductor packages and using deep learning to assess the attributes of these interconnects. Chips representative of stacked 2.5D packages were fabricated and assembled using thermo-compression bonding. Bonding parameters were varied in order to create packages with different bond line thickness, different solder fillet shapes, and various pad alignment scenarios. A commercial 3D X-ray imaging tool was used to create high-quality tomographies of these packages. Deep-learning and computer vision-based methods were employed to automatically detect internal features and measure attributes. A three-step procedure was used for data analysis. In the first step, a bounding box was detected for each region of interest (Copper Pillar, Pad, etc.) using a modified single shot detector object model. In the second step, we isolated features within the region of interest and performed 3D segmentation on them. The third and final step utilized automated 3D metrology using the segmented regions. Robust 3D computer vision techniques were deployed to measure the extent of voids which are key attributes for the chip fabrication and process control step. This is the first part of a multi-part paper.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The recent development of industrial computer tomography (CT) has enabled inspection of the integrity of mechanical parts without physical sectioning. Using X-ray CT (XCT) presents many challenges prohibiting industry from widely implementing the technology. The existence of several variables such as filament current, filter material, and filter thickness is directly related to the presence of noise and influences the accuracy of the inspection process. Noise in the resultant reconstructed image is the result of low-energy X rays being absorbed by the detector causing large variations of brightness on the computer image; other noise sources such as detector variations and electronic noise are further sources of error. Additionally, the reconstruction method, which also has a response to the noise scatter, can contribute to the resulting image noise. The presence of noise can skew the resulting image and create the illusion of pores/defects that are not actually present, thus vastly compromising the results of the analysis. Noise reduction is vital in improving the reliability of CT imaging of additive manufactured components. This article investigates the possibility of reducing noise by using detector filters. The study will investigate the impact of source and detector filters (shown in fig. 1) on image quality. Two filter types of 100-μm-thick aluminum and 100-um-thick copper filters were used, and the results were compared to a conventional tube filter. The workpiece used in this study consisted of a 6-mm Ti6Al4V round bar with designed internal features ranging from 50 to 1,400 μm containing a mixture of voids, two filled with unfused powder and two unfilled. The diameter and depth of defects were characterized using focus variation microscopy and then scanned with a Nikon XTH225 industrial CT to compare the measured internal features. The analysis was carried out using VGStudio Max 3.0 (Volume Graphics, Germany) software package to evaluate surface determination and defects/porosity. Preliminary results indicate that using the aluminum detector filter can reduce the noise by 20 % when scanning the part under certain conditions. Also, for a low-magnification scan using the aluminum detector filter, no difference in noise was evident, but it was noted that the filament current could be reduced, potentially further reducing noise. © 2019 by ASTM International.},

(2) Section 3.3 should be removed and replaced with the following: 3.3. Thermographic Signal Reconstruction, The Thermographic Signal Reconstruction (TSR) is widely used in commercial pulsed thermography systems. In TSR, a polynomial function is fitted to each pixel time history to minimize temporal noise. Images created from the instantaneous logarithmic time derivatives of the fit function are typically viewed and analyzed, since the derivative images are much more sensitive to subsurface features than the original data sequence from the IR camera. Individual pixel time history derivatives can be evaluated quantitatively for automated evaluation or measurement of depth or thermal diffusivity. Once the polynomials have been calculated for each pixel, the coefficients may be archived instead of the original data sequence, resulting in a significant degree of data compression. The implementation of TSR that is used in industrial systems is based on patented and proprietary  technology that has optimized specifically for performance with other components in the system. In this study, we have used the basic form of TSR that has been reported in the literature, which we refer to as “B-TSR”. Our polynomial calculation is based on a standard Matlab polynomial fit. Results presented here using B-TSR do not necessarily represent the performance of commercial TSR systems. (3) The performance of the Thermographic Signal Reconstruction (TSR) method in the experimental study was misrepresented due to the lack of contrast optimization, which was performed on other images in Figure 3. The images 3d and 3e in Figure 3 should be replaced with the contrast optimized results, below: (4) Contrast optimization improves the relative performance of TSR for foreign object defect (FOD) detection, and significantly affects the results of the comparative study. To reflect this, the following sentences on page 5 should be omitted: 1. But PCT can provide the most inspection details and the best definition 2. According to the comparison of the images acquired from different image processing methods, PCT is the best solution for this type of defect using pulsed thermography, (5) The conclusions section should be modified: The sentence: “ For pulsed thermography and lock-in thermography, PCT can provide the best inspection results, since PCT is    both fast and effective” should be removed, and replaced with “Pulsed thermography with TSR or PCT processing, or lock-in thermography with PCT, all provided acceptable inspection results” (6) Table 4 should be removed and replaced with the updated table, below Table 4. Performance of thermographic methods. (Table Presented.)  (7) In Sections 4, 6 and 7, all occurrences of the word ‘TSR’ should be replaced with ‘B-TSR’. (8) Section 6 (“Thermographic Probability of Detection”) should be removed from the paper; (9) Table 4 should be moved to the Conclusion section. The caption should read “Performance of Thermographic Methods” (10) The word “probable” should be eliminated from the following sentence in Section 4.4: The sentence should read as follows: “This may indicate the existence of Defect E” (page 5). (11) The second paragraph in Section 4.4 should be modified to read as follows: The authors increased the heating times to 120 s for pulsed thermography experiments. However, the longer pulse did not provide better inspection results. This is understandable, since the duration of pulse heating should be set to accommodate the thickness and thermal diffusivity of the sample, and both the 30 and 120 s heating durations were significantly longer than the time required for heat to travel through the sample (~5 s). In particular, TSR is sensitive to transient events while heat is still passing through the sample, therefore the long heating periods and late acquisition used may have cancelled some positive effects of TSR. The authors apologize for any inconvenience caused to readers. The authors also apologize for the inconvenience caused by our misrepresentation of the TSR method.

Data was acquired for a wide range of crack sizes and shapes, including mid-bore, corner and through-thickness crack types, and from both standard eddy current hardware and a prototype BHEC system with z-axis position encoding. Signal processing algorithms were developed to process and extract features from the 2D data sets, and inversion algorithms using VIC-3D generated surrogate models were used for inverting crack size. New model results are presented, which now address the effect of having a corner crack at an edge and a through crack adjacent to two edges. A two-step inversion process was implemented that first evaluates the material layer thickness, crack type and location, in order to select the most appropriate VIC-3D surrogate model for subsequent crack sizing inversion step. Inversion results for select mid-bore, through and corner crack specimens are presented where sizing performance was found to be satisfactory in general, but also depend on the size and location of the flaw. © 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.},

	abstract = {X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging for industrial applications is limited to certain physical conditions to be fulfilled. The size of the measuring object and the accumulated wall thickness are two fundamental conditions. An omission of these conditions by not capturing object attenuation information by the x-ray detector leads to missing data in the 3D reconstruction process and results as a consequence in image degradation and artifacts. Conventional industrial x-ray CT is based on cone-beam projections and circular or helical scanning trajectories using linear axis and a rotary (lift) table. For many inspection tasks on big-sized or unusually shaped objects the physical limits for obtaining a sufficient high image quality are reached very quickly when using conventional CT systems. Industrial six-axis robots offer much more flexibility with respect to the conditions mentioned earlier and can overcome the limitations of conventional scanners. In the present work we characterized an industrial six-axis robot in its working space following ISO 9283 in terms of pose accuracy and pose repeatability. These results are then used to simulate faulty scanning trajectories in terms of pose deviations where a single robot is used as an object manipulator to rotate virtual specimens on a circular trajectory resulting in different (faulty) reconstruction datasets. These datasets are evaluated visually and by using performance parameters and geometrical features in order to determine the reproduction fidelity (performance) of a one arm robot-based CT system depending on different pose errors. With the results obtained it was shown that a robot-based CT system of type B (in our classification scheme) using one robot as object manipulator should be able to reach a spatial resolution power in the range of the voxel size (in our case 200 µm) and smaller (neglecting effects from focal spot size, detector unsharpness from x-ray to light conversation and scatter radiation) if systematic pose errors are compensated using appropriate calibration methods. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Thermal management is the critical issue in all present conventional 2D electronic packages, and is more crucial in the case staked dies of advanced 3D IC technology, because of increased power density and complex chip designs. The traditional methods are reaching their limits towards cooling requirement of 3D ICs. The liquid cooling micro-channel are the most attractive for high heat flux mitigation. However, the integration of such micro-channels across the stacked dies, is challenging. In this work, we are proposing a facile method of fabrication and integration of a high reliable, tight sealed inter-die microfluidic channels for 3D ICs. The integration of inter-die microchannel over three stacked layers has been developed with titanium silicide as a bonding interface by simultaneous application of optimal heat and force is matching towards CMOS compatibility. Here, we demonstrated the reaction mechanism of titanium (Ti) and importance of Ti thickness across the bonding interface. The temperature and load optimizations carried out using the surface profile of Ti using AFM before bonding, and interface inspection after bonding, by using, C-SAM and razorblade insertion. The interface reactions and thickness of Ti optimization has inspected using X-FESEM and EDS profile. After conforming void free high reliable bonding interface, at optimized conditions, we fabricated fine pitch (200 μ m) with 100 μm width and 40 μm depth micro-channels at inter-dies of three-layer stacked silicon structure using titanium as interlayer. Along with, we demonstrated the micro channel integration across the stacked wafers for future high performance 3D IC designs in a facile approach. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Since nickel-coated steel is widely used to prevent rust, it is used in large rolled steel plates in paper mills. It is necessary to inspect the thickness of the nickel layer on nickel-coated steel in the production process to guarantee quality. Moreover, in a real plant, the inspection of the nickel layer on the opposite side of a rolled steel plate is required. The conductivity of the nickel layer in the nickel-coated steel plate is higher than that of the mother steel, and its permeability is lower than that of the mother steel. Therefore, the thickness of the nickel layer can be estimated on the basis of the differences in these electromagnetic properties. In this paper, an electromagnetic inspection method for measuring the thickness of the nickel layer on the opposite side using a pulsed magnetic field is proposed. The detailed phenomenon of the inspection method is examined by the 3D nonlinear finite element method (FEM) considering the hysteresis magnetization curves of both nickel and the mother steel plate. It is shown that the electromagnetic inspection of the thickness of the nickel layer is possible by using the output voltage of a search coil of the proposed sensor. © MYU K.K.},

As water jet spot welding is a concise time welding process, numerical analysis can optimize it and examine the effect of input parameters on plastic deformation and stress distribution that would be difficult to measure experimentally. In this study, the entire water jet spot welding process of aluminum HS30 is modeled through ABAQUS/EXPLICIT based on an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation which helps to alleviate many of the traditional Lagrangian-based implementation drawbacks. Three-dimensional (3D) models are used to evaluate the effect of water jet velocity, flyer stand-off distance (SD), and flyer thicknesses during the process. The weld’s quality in terms of failure or success is also investigated by using stress and strain measures.

Recent advancements have enabled accurate 3D numerical modeling of complex well casings, but few have investigated the feasibility of imaging the fracturing fluid using the electrical method. In this work, we develop an interactive inversion scheme powered by a fast forward modeling algorithm using an equivalent resistor network (RESnet). Our inversion fits anomalies in time-lapse differential data, so biases caused by inaccuracy in the background model can be cancelled out. The fluid model is parameterized as a polygon of full saturation on the fracture plane and a thickness-integrated conductivity of the fluid sheet. Surface electrical field data are mapped to the HSV (hue, saturation, value) color space to aid visual inspection and model adjustment by hand. In our blind test with the presence of three horizontal wells, the computing time of one trial model was about 8 s and the geometry and conductivity of an asymmetric fluid slab was imaged after 30 trials; the entire inversion is completed within 20 minutes including both human and computer time on a desktop PC.

In this work, we propose using N-doped graphene (NG)/wax composites, where an interconnected 3D graphene network is used as filler in a wax matrix. Nitrogen atoms were substitutionally doped into the graphene lattice by hydrothermal method. It was found that controlling the amount of NG could effectively modulate the electrical properties of graphene. Inspection of the samples prepared showed that to a large extent, the vacuum infusion method effectively retained the graphene intact 3D structure. Samples filled with 3.6 wt% NG exhibited the most prominent microwave absorption properties; the minimum reflection loss registered was 53.25 dB at 13.10 GHz for a sample thickness of 3.3 mm, and the bandwidth of the reflection loss less than 10 dB (90% absorption) can reach up to 8.15 GHz. The result indicates that the nitrogen-doped graphene can greatly improve the dielectric loss of electromagnetic wave absorber. More importantly, the work presented provides the framework for a unique facile approach to manufacture low-cost NG/wax composites with strong electromagnetic wave absorption ability at very low filler loading. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Stent quality control is a critical process. Coronary stents have to be inspected 100% so no defective stent is implanted into a human body. We have developed a high numerical aperture optical stent inspection system able to acquire both 2D and 3D images. Combining a rotational stage, an area camera with line-scan capability and a triple illumination arrangement, unrolled sections of the outer, inner, and sidewalls surfaces are obtained with high resolution. During stent inspection, surface roughness and coating thickness uniformity is of high interest. Due to the non-planar shape of the surface of the stents, the thickness values of the coating need to be corrected with the 3D surface local slopes. A theoretical model and a simulation are proposed, and a measurement with white light interferometry is shown. Confocal and spectroscopic reflectometry showed to be limited in this application due to stent surface roughness. Due to the high numerical aperture of the optical system, only certain parts of the stent are in focus, which is a problem for defect detection, specifically on the sidewalls. In order to obtain fully focused 2D images, an extended depth of field algorithm has been implemented. A comparison between pixel variance and Laplacian filtering is shown. To recover the stack image, two different methods are proposed: maximum projection and weighted intensity. Finally, we also discuss the implementation of the processing algorithms in both the CPU and GPU, targeting real-time 2-Million pixel image acquisition at 50 frames per second. © 2017 SPIE.},

	abstract = {Highly conductive steel cased wells have been proposed to be used as long electrodes in the electrical survey for hydraulic fracturing monitoring. Recent advancements have enabled accurate 3D numerical modeling of complex well casings, but few have investigated the feasibility of imaging the fracturing fluid using the electrical method. In this work, we develop an interactive inversion scheme powered by a fast forward modeling algorithm using an equivalent resistor network (RESnet). Our inversion fits anomalies in time-lapse differential data, so biases caused by inaccuracy in the background model can be cancelled out. The fluid model is parameterized as a polygon of full saturation on the fracture plane and a thickness-integrated conductivity of the fluid sheet. Surface electrical field data are mapped to the HSV (hue, saturation, value) color space to aid visual inspection and model adjustment by hand. In our blind test with the presence of three horizontal wells, the computing time of one trial model was about 8 s and the geometry and conductivity of an asymmetric fluid slab was imaged after 30 trials; the entire inversion is completed within 20 minutes including both human and computer time on a desktop PC. Our results show the feasibility of electrical method in high-resolution fracturing fluid monitoring, as well as the practicality of interactive inversion in real-time imaging. © 2019 SEG},

This method improves the projective mode and reduces fringe distortion compared to the original triangulation method. Meanwhile, through calibration of the sinusoidal fringe and the windowed Fourier transform (WFT) of a one-dimensional signal, the distorted fringe formed by modulating the grating fringe of steel plate thickness and surface defects can be processed. Finally, the three-dimensional shape of the steel plate can be reconstructed and, thus, the steel plate thickness and surface defects can be obtained. The experimental results show that this method can enhance inspection speed and ensure that the detection error is no more than ±0.03 mm. © 2018 Polish Psychiatric Association. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In order to evaluate the sensitivity of defect inspection systems, it is convenient to examine simulated data. This gives the possibility to tune the parameters of the inspection method and to test the performance of the system in critical cases. In this paper, a simple method for the simulation of defects in radioscopic images of aluminum castings is presented. The approach simulates only the flaws and not the whole radioscopic image of the object under test. A 3D flaw is modeled as an ellipsoidal cavity, which is projected and superimposed onto real radioscopic images of an homogeneous object according to the exponential attenuation law for X-rays. The new gray value of a pixel, where the 3D flaw is projected, depends only on four parameters: a) the original gray value; b) the linear absorption coefficient of the examined material; c) the maximal thickness observable in the radioscopic image; and d) the length of the intersection of the 3D flaw with the modeled X-ray beam, that is projected into the pixel. A simulation of an ellipsoidal flaw of any size and orientation can be done in any position of the casting by using the algorithm described in this paper. This allows the evaluation of the performance of defect inspection systems in cases where the detection is known to be difficult. © 2001 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: On MRI, focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is characterized by a combination of increased cortical thickness, hyperintense signal within the dysplastic lesion, and blurred transition between gray and white matter (GM-WM). The visual identification of these abnormal characteristics may be difficult, and it is unclear to what degree these features occur among different FCD lesions. Our purpose was to investigate the pattern of occurrence of abnormal MRI characteristics in FCD by using a set of computational models and to generate quantitative lesion profiling. Methods: A set of voxel-wise operators was applied to high-resolution 3D T1-weighted MRI in 23 patients with histologically proven FCD and 39 healthy controls, creating maps of GM thickness, maps of relative intensity highlighting areas with hyperintense signal, and maps of gradient magnitude modeling the GM-WM transition. All FCD lesions were segmented manually on the T1-weighted MRI. Results: FCD volumes ranged from 734 mm3 to 80,726 mm3 (mean, 8,629 mm3± 16,238). The manually segmented FCD lesions were used to estimate features in the lesional area and to determine possible local variations of each feature by means of a histogram. In 78% of the patients, FCD lesions were characterized by simultaneous GM thickening, hyperintense signal, and blurring of the GM-WM transition. Moreover, in all patients, the FCD lesion had at least two of these three characteristics. Conclusions: The three features occurred regardless of the lesion volume, and they characterized not only large FCD lesions, but also subtle ones that had been overlooked by conventional radiologic inspection before surgery. © 2006 International League Against Epilepsy.},

	abstract = {The magnetostatic analysis is important on corrosion detection problems, nondestructive inspection of structures and biomagnetism measurement. Boundary element method (BEM) is often used to the magnetostatic analysis conventionally because BEM does not require the discretization of the magnetostatic field domain and has an advantage for open domain problems. On the other hand, 2D BEM is more accurate and more efficient than 3D BEM to calculate the electrostatic field of flat plate shaped and thickness uniform electrostatic field domain. However, in case of the magnetostatic field should be calculated, the conventional method requires numerical calculation of electric potentials at discrete sample points in the electrostatic field domain, and numerical region integration of the discrete points. This research has developed a new boundary element method for analyzing magnetostatic field induced by flat plate shaped and thickness uniform electrostatic field domain. This method describes magnetic vector potential and magnetic flux density as the similar form of 2D BEM for the electrostatic field analysis. Since the magnetostatic field can be calculated directly from the results of 2D BEM for the electrostatic field analysis, the accuracy and computational time are improved. In order to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the present method, some example problems are solved and the results are compared with the conventional method. Present method is also applied to the practical problem which is an inspection of lithium-ion batteries. © 2013 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

Then, an adaptive antenna positioning model based on six sensors was proposed and electromagnetic transmitter and receiver circuits were designed. Based on the model, a linear equation containing six unknown numbers was derived and three kinds of algorithms were used to analyze and simulate the equation. Finally, engineering experiments were performed on the pipes with different thicknesses and burial depths. The experiment on a pipe wall thickness of 5.74 mm and burried deep from 0.8 to 0.2 m shows that the average position error is 18.7 cm, which has been decreased by 3.4 cm compared with that of the original model.

Our goal is to estimate S-wave velocity of each pavement layer such as asphalt concrete or road base, and to evaluate deterioration and damage of the pavement. To that end, we think that it is necessary to estimate thickness of pavement accurately by GPR. We conducted some field experiments including GPR measurement which was carried out on a pavement where cracks and wheel ruts were obvious. First, we detected the wheel ruts on a road surface by using vehicle mounted 3D Laser Scanner, and we extracted cracks by visual observation of the road surface. Next we carried out GPR survey of 0.25m grid by using an antenna which has a central frequency of 800MHz. From the analysis result of GPR, two subsidence areas of road base along the longitudinal direction were caught. The magnitude of the subsidence did not match the depth of wheel ruts. We analyzed the relations between the thickness of road base and the crack distribution. We found that the crack went on increasing at the thinner layer of road base. In order to validate the results of GPR, we conducted borehole camera inspection at several check drillings on the pavement. We confirmed that the estimated thickness of road base was consistent with borehole camera image. In the next phase of application to the high-frequency surface wave method, if we use a priori information of those layer thicknesses as strong constraints, we think that it will be possible to determine more accurate S-wave velocity of the pavement by inverting high frequency dispersion curves.},

An analysis, test, and non-destructive evaluation program was developed to evaluate the failure mechanisms in a 3DFRFC composite sandwich structure at cold temperatures. Specimen loading included through-thickness tension, compression, and shear. The manufactured samples were verified using through-transmission ultrasonic inspection. The testing of the through-the-thickness 3DFRFC specimens demonstrated increased compressive and tensile strength for increased specimen size. The through-the-thickness strength was observed to be higher than a comparable unreinforced foam core with marginal impact of cold temperature on the strength of the larger specimens. Detailed finite element analysis was used to understand the thermal interaction of the constituents within the specimen and clarify an observed reduction in shear strength.

	abstract = {Pulmonary diseases such as bronchiectasis, asthma, and emphysema are characterized by abnormalities in airway dimensions. Multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) has become one of the primary means to depict these abnormalities, as the availability of high-resolution near-isotropic data makes it possible to evaluate airways at oblique angles to the scanner plane. However, currently, clinical evaluation of airways is typically limited to subjective visual inspection only: systematic evaluation of the airways to take advantage of high-resolution data has not proved practical without automation. We present an automated method to quantitatively evaluate airway lumen diameter, wall thickness and broncho-arterial ratios. In addition, our method provides 3D visualization of these values, graphically illustrating the location and extent of disease. Our algorithm begins by automatic airway segmentation to extract paths to the distal airways, and to create a map of airway diameters. Normally, airway diameters decrease as paths progress distally; failure to taper indicates abnormal dilatation. Our approach monitors airway lumen diameters along each airway path in order to detect abnormal profiles, allowing even subtle degrees of pathologic dilatation to be identified. Our method also systematically computes the broncho-arterial ratio at every terminal branch of the tree model, as a ratio above 1 indicates potentially abnormal bronchial dilatation. Finally, the airway wall thickness is computed at corresponding locations. These measurements are used to highlight abnormal branches for closer inspection, and can be summed to compute a quantitative global score for the entire airway tree, allowing reproducible longitudinal assessment of disease severity. Preliminary tests on patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis demonstrated rapid identification of lack of tapering, which also was confirmed by corresponding demonstration of elevated broncho-arterial ratios.},

According to reservoir modeling and numerical simulation, the remaining oil distribution patterns of the meandering river reservoir controlled by different hierarchy architecture elements and development factors were summarized, which are composite meandering belt including lateral facies change and interlayer interference, single meandering belt including interformational rhythm and abandoned channel barrier, lateral accretion bodies including lateral accretion shale bedding barrier. And the recovery measures for remaining oil controlled by lateval auertion shale bedding were proposed. The results show that the lateral accretion bedding thickness in single well of Gudao Oilfield is about 0. 2-0. 8 m, extending to 2/3 thickness of channel sandbody downward and inclining to abandoned channel, and dip angle is 5°-10°. Coincidence rate of history matching is perfect in single well, and the remaining oil saturation data of inspection well 11J11 prove reliability of the numerical simulation result.

	abstract = {For the last decade, it has been shown that neuroimaging can be a potential tool for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and also fusion of different modalities can further provide the complementary information to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Here, we focus on the problems of both feature representation and fusion of multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). To our best knowledge, the previous methods in the literature mostly used hand-crafted features such as cortical thickness, gray matter densities from MRI, or voxel intensities from PET, and then combined these multimodal features by simply concatenating into a long vector or transforming into a higher-dimensional kernel space. In this paper, we propose a novel method for a high-level latent and shared feature representation from neuroimaging modalities via deep learning. Specifically, we use Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM). 22Although it is clear from the context that the acronym DBM denotes "Deep Boltzmann Machine" in this paper, we would clearly indicate that DBM here is not related to "Deformation Based Morphometry"., a deep network with a restricted Boltzmann machine as a building block, to find a latent hierarchical feature representation from a 3D patch, and then devise a systematic method for a joint feature representation from the paired patches of MRI and PET with a multimodal DBM. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed experiments on ADNI dataset and compared with the state-of-the-art methods. In three binary classification problems of AD vs. healthy Normal Control (NC), MCI vs. NC, and MCI converter vs. MCI non-converter, we obtained the maximal accuracies of 95.35%, 85.67%, and 74.58%, respectively, outperforming the competing methods. By visual inspection of the trained model, we observed that the proposed method could hierarchically discover the complex latent patterns inherent in both MRI and PET. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

This gives the possibility to tune the parameters of the inspection method and to test the performance of the system in cases where the detection is known to be difficult. In this paper, an interactive environment for the simulation of defects in radioscopic images of aluminium castings is presented. The approach simulates only the flaws and not the whole radioscopic image of the object under test. A manifold surface is used to model a flaw with complex geometry, which is projected and superimposed onto real radioscopic images of a homogeneous object according to the exponential attenuation law for X-rays. The new grey value of a pixel, where the 3D flaw is projected, depends only on four parameters: a) the grey value of the original X-ray image without flaw; b) the linear absorption coefficient of the examined material; c) the maximal thickness observable in the radioscopic image; and d) the length of the intersection of the 3D flaw with the modelled X-ray beam, that is projected into the pixel. The approach allows the user the simulation of complex flaws at any position of an aluminium casting. Simulation results of flaws like blow holes and cracks on X-ray images are shown and contrasted with real digital images with real flaws.},

	abstract = {As double patterning techniques such as spacer double/quadruple patterning mature, ArF water immersion lithography is expected to be applied down to the 1x nm hp node or beyond. This will necessitate precise process control solutions to accommodate extremely small process windows. In the case of spacer double/quadruple patterning in particular, CD uniformity of the final feature is strongly related to the lithography performance of the initial pre-spacer feature. CD uniformity of the resist image is affected by many sources. In the case of the exposure tool, CD error on the reticle, as well as exposure dose and focus errors are the key factors. For the resist process, heterogeneity of the stacked resist film thickness, post exposure bake (PEB) plate temperature, and development all have an impact. Furthermore, the process wafer also has error sources that include under-layer non-uniformities or wafer flatness. Fortunately, the majorities of these non-uniformities are quite stable in a volume production process. To improve and maintain the CD uniformity, a technique to calculate exposure dose and focus correction values simultaneously using the measured resist image feature was reported previously [1]. Further, a demonstration of a correction loop using a neural network calculation model was reported in SPIE 2010 [2], and the corrected CD uniformity was less than 1.5 nm (3 sigma) within a wafer. For further improvement, a demonstration of precise dose and focus control using high order field-by-field correction was then reported at SPIE 2011[3]. In that work, the interand intra-field CD uniformities reported were less than 1 nm (3 sigma) respectively. A key aspect of this method is the simultaneous compensation of dose and focus offsets, which successfully maximizes the process margin of a target pattern. The Nikon CDU Master then derives the optimal control parameters for each compensation function in the scanner using the exposure dose and focus correction data, with the NSR-S620 scanner having the capabilities to also control higher order dose and focus distribution. This high degree of controllability ultimately enables precise correction of the complicated CD error distribution that is caused by heterogeneities in the process. In this work, this correction concept was expanded to include contact hole CD uniformity optimization and quick correction method using the AMI-3500 auto macro inspection tool. A 3D contour analysis method is used for contact hole CDs measured by CD-SEM. The contact hole CD is then corrected directly without using any other monitor pattern features. Further, using the Nikon AMI-3500 system, it is possible to successfully extract the adjustment components using the optical diffraction image. Since the AMI measurement time is very quick (just a few minutes), a regular correction loop using the AMI may be a promising solution for system auto correction in an IC manufacturing facility. © 2012 SPIE.},

	abstract = {The piping inspection in nuclear power plants is mainly performed in contact with ultrasonic wedge transducers. During the scanning, the fixed shape of the wedges cannot conform to the irregular surfaces and complex geometries of the components (butt weld, nozzle, elbow). The surface irregularities lead to thickness variations of the coupling medium that result in beam distortions and losses of sensitivity. A 3-D ultrasonic flexible phased-array is presented here and applied to the ultrasonic inspection of a welded pipe. This example of a complex geometry inspection is typical of the field of application for such sensor. The phased-array probe is flexible to conform to a complex profile and to minimize the thickness of the coupling layer. The independent piezoelectric elements composing the radiating surface are mechanically assembled to build an articulated structure. A profilometer, embedded in the transducer, measures the local surface distortion allowing to compute in real-time the optimized delay laws and to compensate the distortions of the 2D or 3D profiles. Those delay laws transferred to the UT-acquisition system are applied in real-time to the piezoelectric elements. The experiments presented here aim to determine the detection abilities of this technique using multi-shot configurations (e.g. angular scanning, several points focusing). © 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {Objective: A procedure for acquisition, automated registration, and fusion of functional and anatomical magnetic resonance images is presented. Its accuracy is quantitatively assessed using a publicly available gold standard. A patient case is used to illustrate the technique's clinical usefulness in image-guided neurosurgery. Materials and Methods: Before and after functional MRI (fMRI) acquisition, additional anatomical images were acquired at spatial locations identical to those of the functional images (5-10 slices) for the purpose of voxel-based image registration. Registration accuracy of the anatomical volumes and high-resolution 3D MRI volumes (MP-RAGE imaging) was quantified using adapted data (8 patients) originating from the Vanderbilt Retrospective Registration Evaluation Project (NIH project 1 R01 NS33926-02). Selecting three subsets of slices from that data (5 slices/6 mm slice distance, 10 slices/3 mm distance, and 10 slices/6 mm distance), the small number of images available from fMRI acquisition was taken into account. Accuracies in registering these sparse data sets were then compared to the accuracy achieved using complete data. For clinical patient data (16 patients), fMRI images were fused with MP-RAGE images, thereby integrating anatomical images with information about the locations of functional areas. The resulting images were used for planning and navigation during tumor resections using an operating microscope (MKM, Zeiss). Results: Quantitative analysis showed no loss of registration accuracy due to a reduced number of slices, regardless of whether 5 or 10 slices were used. For small-volume coverage in the anatomical images (thickness 24 mm), registration of one patient failed, and this could easily be identified by visual inspection. No failures were experienced when 54 mm was covered. In the clinical environment, all 16 interventions using fused fMRI and MRI data were successful. Conclusions: Automatic registration of functional and high-resolution anatomical MRI was found to be sufficiently accurate and reliable for use in stereotactic neurosurgery. ©2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Ultrasonic guided waves are attractive for rapid remote screening of large structures and today they are widely used in several practical applications including the inspection of pipe and plate installations. More recently, guided wave modal solutions confined in extended local features have attracted much research interest, offering the possibility of inspecting complex geometric or topographical features. Such feature-guided wave (FGW) modes have been reported in plate waveguides with local cross-section variation or curvature, and in annular circular cylinders with cross-sectional anomalies. This paper focuses on FGW phenomena in 90 degree structural bends in plate structures, which commonly occur in various industrial structures. Modal studies are carried out using the Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) method, while 3D finite element (FE) simulations are used to gain visualization of results and also obtain cross-validation. Our studies reveal, perhaps for the first time, the possibility of bend-guided modes of the shear-horizontal (SH) family, in addition those of the Rayleigh-Lamb family reported earlier in the literature. This mode has attractive properties including low attenuation and limited dispersion. We investigate effects of plate thickness and bend radius on the physics of FGW in bends, arguing the strong role of geometry and curvature effects in causing mode confinement. Preliminary experiments have also been carried out to validate the existence of such bend-guided mode. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

	abstract = {For an increasing number of drug formulations critical attributes of active substances, excipients and intermediates, and overall product performances are linked to chemical and physical parameters at microscopic scale. Therefore the evaluation of bulk properties by current analytical methods is no longer sufficient. In contrast chemical imaging offers spatially resolved sensing of the distribution of components and features in a sample. 2-D imaging performed off-line and even on-line demonstrated its usefulness to deliver information of solid drug formulations, powders, packaging, etc. Nowadays progress in spectroscopy enables 3-D imaging with details inside samples to be probed. Ideally spatial resolution is obtained in the z-direction during x-y sensing of the sample surface in a non-destructive fashion, comprising neither sample preparation nor operational limitations. Therefore THz-TDS imaging constitutes a promising imaging technique to map the internal structures of solid formulations. Implementing 2-D and 3-D imaging techniques for non-invasive sample analysis will increase our understanding of drug processing and reveal hitherto unobserved details in the internal structure of finished products. Besides improved product understanding targets that can be achieved are fewer analytical tests and correspondingly savings in development time and cost. © 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag & Co. KGaA.

	abstract = {Visual inspection of structures is a highly qualitative method in which inspectors visually assess a structure's condition. If a region is inaccessible, binoculars must be used to detect and characterize defects. Although several Non-Destructive Testing methods have been proposed for inspection purposes, they are nonadaptive and cannot quantify crack thickness reliably. In this paper, a contact-less remote-sensing crack detection and quantification methodology based on 3D scene reconstruction (computer vision), image processing, and pattern recognition concepts is introduced. The proposed approach utilizes depth perception to detect cracks and quantify their thickness, thereby giving a robotic inspection system the ability to analyze images captured from any distance and using any focal length or resolution. This unique adaptive feature is especially useful for incorporating mobile systems, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, into structural inspection methods since it would allow inaccessible regions to be properly inspected for cracks. Guidelines are presented for optimizing the acquisition and processing of images, thereby enhancing the quality and reliability of the damage detection approach and allowing the capture of even the slightest cracks (e.g., detection of 0.1 mm cracks from a distance of 20 m), which are routinely encountered in realistic field applications where the camera-object distance and image contrast are not controllable. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Atherosclerosis at the carotid bifurcation can result in cerebral emboli, which in turn can block the blood supply to the brain causing ischemic strokes. Noninvasive imaging tools that better characterize arterial wall, and atherosclerotic plaque structure and composition may help to determine the factors which lead to the development of unstable lesions, and identify patients at risk of plaque disruption and stroke. Carotid magnetic resonance (MR) imaging allows for the characterization of carotid vessel wall and plaque composition, the characterization of normal and pathological arterial wall, the quantification of plaque size, and the detection of plaque integrity. On the other hand, various ultrasound (US) measurements have also been used to quantify atherosclerosis, carotid stenosis, intima-media thickness, total plaque volume, total plaque area, and vessel wall volume. Combining the complementary information provided by 3D MR and US carotid images may lead to a better understanding of the underlying compositional and textural factors that define plaque and wall vulnerability, which may lead to better and more effective stroke prevention strategies and patient management. Combining these images requires nonrigid registration to correct the nonlinear misalignments caused by relative twisting and bending in the neck due to different head positions during the two image acquisition sessions. The high degree of freedom and large number of parameters associated with existing nonrigid image registration methods causes several problems including unnatural plaque morphology alteration, high computational complexity, and low reliability. Thus, a "twisting and bending" model was used with only six parameters to model the normal movement of the neck for nonrigid registration. The registration technique was evaluated using 3D US and MR carotid images at two field strengths, 1.5 and 3.0 T, of the same subject acquired on the same day. The mean registration error between the segmented carotid artery wall boundaries in the target US image and the registered MR images was calculated using a distance-based error metric after applying a "twisting and bending" model based nonrigid registration algorithm. An average registration error of 1.4±0.3 mm was obtained for 1.5 T MR and 1.5±0.4 mm for 3.0 T MR, when registered with 3D US images using the nonrigid registration technique presented in this paper. Visual inspection of segmented vessel surfaces also showed a substantial improvement of alignment with this nonrigid registration technique compared to rigid registration. © 2009 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

	abstract = {Mapping of groundwater aquifers has historically followed the path of 2D geological maps and interpreted cross sections derived from available geological borehole data. Isopachs or aquifer thicknesses are then derived from data layers. The addition of geophysical interpretation, through methods such as gravity and electro-magnetic surveys provide some confidence of continuity between boreholes. The advent of GIS and modern computer modelling has stretched the data further into the three dimensional digital world with the use of high-end numerical modelling and high-tech visualisation tools. Input data may be assessed for quality and integrity. However, rarely are the digital data layers assessed by visual inspection. With a visual inspection the influence of individual data points on data layers is more easily accounted for, enabling a more rigorous assessment of the quality and or suitability of input data. Visual inspection aids in the identification of geological structures that often have significant impacts on groundwater dynamics, where such structures are often not identifiable from 2 dimensional borehole data. Visual inspection also allows a range of experts to view the aquifers in a multi- dimensional state and apply additional knowledge to the development of the models. While many models may be based upon all available data, we argue that without visual assessment they are not based upon all available interpretation and assessment tools. We propose that models of complicated geological systems undergo several stages of visual assessment, including for example: 1. Integration of raw data sets and preliminary 3 dimensional model development, 2. Visualisation of layers, identification of spurious data and any geological features and discussion of where or what additional data sets are required (e.g., geophysics etc). The aim of the research is to develop a methodology to provide proper representation of the subsurface geology to enable the development of a better understanding of aquifers and the water resource contained within. By making use of the increased speed and capacity of 3D visualisation software and hardware, more reliable conceptual models for groundwater sustainability investigations and better communication tools to explain the results to stakeholders can be produced. © MODSIM 2009.All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Impact damage is a harmful defect, which is easily induced in composite structures during manufacturing and in-service. Impulse ultrasonic wave reflections in carbon fiber-reinforced composites (CFRC) are analyzed. Ultrasonic surface dead-zone (USDZ) and lateral resolution (LR) can be improved markedly when time-width of probe pulse (TWOPP) is decreased reasonably and its property is polished appropriately. The datum about depth and size of impact damages in CFRC body can be extracted from ultrasonic reflected signals at damages and their time-of-flight (TOF). B-scan and C-scan in depth (or T-scan) imaging techniques based on the investigated high-resolution ultrasonic method are employed to explore the details and to carry out visualized inspection and quantitative evaluation of impact damages induced in CFRC laminated specimens. Experimental results have shown that time-resolved reflections resulted from defects nearby CFRC specimen surface can be obtained distinctly when their TOFs are close to the half of TWOPP and probe pulse has a single duration in time domain. In this case, the USDZ and LR can be approximately reached to the thickness of a single pre-preg ply of CFRC laminate, i.e., 0.13 mm. The distribution and development as well as depth of impact damages in cross-section of the CFRC laminated specimens can be seen well by using serials of B-scan imaging technique. The quantitative information about impact damage zone and size along layup direction of CFRC laminated specimens can be excavated and determined exactly by using ultrasonic T-scan imaging method. The combination of the two kinds of imaging methods provides a powerful imaging and quantitative approaches for evaluation of impact damage as well as visual exploring 3D behavior of impact damage in CFRC laminates.},

	abstract = {Purpose - The main advantages of vapour phase soldering are a non-oxygen environment, the elimination of overheating and the possibility of the vacuum application, which can guarantee undeniably higher quality of solder joints, especially as regards void formation. These features are less affected by the alloy composition. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/ approach - The quality of solder joints made in two VPS options (with and without vacuum) was investigated in terms of voids formation. Solder alloys of 37%Pb63%Sn (PbSn) and 96%Sn3.5%Ag0.5%Cu (SAC 305) were applied to an etched Cu layer on a glass-epoxy substrate using the screen-printing method. 1206 SMD resistors were placed on the solder pads with a Quadra pick-and place machine. For the inspection of joint structure and void identification, 3D X-ray images of samples were taken using a computed tomography system with a 180 kV/15 W nanofocus. For comparison, traditional cross-sections of the samples were performed using a metallographic polisher. The cross-section analysis was done in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). To confirm the relevance of these data, a statistical analysis was carried out. Findings - The paper shows that alloy composition has less impact on the quality of joints as regards void formation. The tendency for a different arrangement of voids in a junction depending on the distance SMD element and the thickness of the solder layer was investigated using X-ray computed tomography. Originality/value - The use of 3D computed tomography for void investigation gives full information about the internal structure of the joint and allows for precise void identification. Vacuum application during the soldering allows significant voids elimination. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Life of a gas turbine vane generally depends on different factors such as scatter of material properties, load variation and manufacturing tolerances. However, deterministic finite element (FE) life analysis gives just a discrete value typically based on the nominal or worst case conditions. It precludes considering sensitivity to the input parameters and obtaining the expected life range. To consider the possible variations of the input parameters from their nominal values, a probabilistic approach has been applied to compute the LCF (Low Cyclic Fatigue) and creep life distributions for the uncooled vane. The deterministic 3D FE life assessment of the gas turbine components is based on the input data such as physical and mechanical properties of the base material and coating at operating temperatures, nominal geometry of the component, thermal and mechanical loadings. Each of the above mentioned inputs has its own scatter band characterized either by average and minimum values of mechanical properties (tensile strength, LCF, creep) or by variations of manufacturing tolerances; thermal boundary conditions and gas pressure distribution. The probabilistic life analysis has been performed in order to assess individual impact of each input on vane's life scatter. LCF and creep life distributions as well as variation of the base metal oxidation layer thickness have been obtained for each scatter factor and for their overall contribution. It is seen from results that LCF and creep lives of the analyzed vane have been influenced mainly by material properties and secondarily by OTDF (hot gas temperature variation in the circumferential direction) and uncertainties of thermal boundary conditions, which depended on the operation conditions of the engine. Manufacturing tolerances and alternation of ambient air temperature in the compressor intake have the lowest impact. The derived model is useful for the risk analysis or maintenance planning. For instance, it has been shown how probability of small fatigue crack indication in one vane can be extended onto the overall probability for the failure detection of n vanes at the stator stage during regular inspection. The probability of micro crack growth due to creep after the determined amount of operating hours for the single vane may be also redefined into the overall stage probability for the detection of n such vanes. To perform validation, normalized field data have been used for comparison with the analytical predictions. Good correlations between the field data and analytical predictions have been shown.

	abstract = {Aerial image measurement system (AIMSTM) has been widely used for wafer level inspection of mask defects. Reported inspection flows include die-to-die (D2D) and die-to-database (D2DB) methods. For patterns that do not repeat in another die, only the D2DB approach is applicable. The D2DB method requires accurate simulation of AIMS measurements for a mask pattern. An optical vectorial model is needed to depict the mask diffraction effect in this simulation. To accurately simulate the imaging results, a rigorous electro-magnetic field (EMF) model is essential to correctly take account of the EMF scattering induced by the mask topography, which is usually called the mask 3D effect. In this study, the mask 3D model we use is rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA), which calculates the diffraction fields from a single plane wave incidence. A hybrid Hopkins-Abbe method with RCWA is used to calculate the EMF diffraction at a desired accuracy level while keeping the computation time practical. We will compare the speed of the hybrid Hopkins-Abbe method to the rigorous Abbe method. The matching between simulation and experiment is more challenging for AIMS than CD-SEM because its measurements provide full intensity information. Parameters in the mask 3D model such as film stack thickness or film optical properties, is optimized during the fitting process. We will report the fitting results of AIMS images for twodimensional structures with various pitches. By accurately simulating the AIMS measurements, it provides a necessary tool to perform the mask inspection using the D2DB approach and to accurately predict the mask defects. © 2015 SPIE.},

	abstract = {Geophysical imaging methods facilitate the oriented measurements of geological discontinuity planes in boreholes. To calculate true dip and strike of planes additional information about borehole deviation and caliper is needed. Borehole cameras can only be used to determine the orientation of single planes, their main field of operation is the qualitative description of discontinuities. Cameras are also used for the inspection of cased holes. Borehole scanning tools provide an unrol led, oriented image of the borehole wall from which the sinusoidal traces of geological planes are manually picked. From the raw data 3D images of the borehole wall, tadpole- and polar-diagrams and frequency-plots of the planes can be calculated. The data sets can be exported in ASCII format. The Optical Borehole Imager uses a camera- and mirror-instrumentation that is fixed inside the tool to give a high resolution image of the borehole wall in true colours. The OBI requires good visibility conditions. The tool is also used as a quick-look method for casing inspection. The Acoustic Borehole Imager scans the borehole wall with a rotating ultrasonic transmitter-receiver head. The method only works in fluid-filled boreholes but as it does not require visibility, it can be logged in drilling mud as well. As the ABI not only measures amplitude but also travel time of the signal, also an oriented 360°-precision caliper of the borehole can be calculated. In well centred plastic-casings the ABI can read the discontinuities of the formation even through the casing. If the ABI is a full wave tool, it can be used to measure deformations and wall thickness of metal casing with high precision. The Formation Micro Imager scans the discontinuities with fo ur to six pads that are hydraulically pressed to the borehole wall. A multi-electrode configuration on each pad measures the electric resistivity of the formation close to the borehole wall. The main field of work of the FMI are hydrocarbon exploration wells, at the moment it is of little importance in geological and geotechnical boreholes.},

	abstract = {The appeal of LTCC (Low Temperature Coined Ceramic) process lies in the possibility of creating multilayer (3D) structures, integrating conductor paths, passive elements, such as inductors and resistors and resonance cavities. Unfortunately, the very nature of coined device makes post-firing optical inspection of buried elements impossible, as the ceramic material is opaque to visible light. This limitation, however, does not exist at X-ray wavelengths. The aim of this paper is to provide a practical overview of application of high resolution X-ray imaging for non-destructive inspection and fault detection in multilayer LTCC structures. First, we present a simplified mathematical description of X-ray absorption inside an LTCC structure and demonstrate that due to physical properties of substrate (glass/A1203 ceramic), conductor material (silver) and cavity fill (air), a high contrast image of the investigated structure can be obtained. Next, we show application of a commercial off-the shelf industrial X-ray system for imaging various faults in LTCC structures, such as: via voids (caused by inadequate filling of a via hole with conductor material), microcracks, paste creep (during lamination, excess via conductor leaks out of the via hole and in between the tape layers, shorting the via to an adjacent circuit), interruptions in conductor paths and alignment errors. We also demonstrate application of computed tomography for verifying 3D geometry of buried resonance cavities and detecting tape delaminations. Finally, we discuss limitations of the method, related to structure thickness (number of layers), material composition, imaging geometry and equipment characteristics, such as detector resolution and spatial noise. © Copyright Honeywell Federal Manufacturing & Technologies LLC, 2011.},

	abstract = {For workpiece inspection applications such as internal edge measurement verifications, three-dimensional (3D) data processing for detecting the internal and external surfaces of the object is required. Rather than detecting edge points on each slice of CT image (2D) and stacking them up, we detect the 3D surface points directly from a sequence of CT images. Using this strategy, surfaces whose normals are vertical to the slices can be detected. We present a set of 3D edge detection methods, facet-model-based, morphology-based, and wavelet-based for evaluation. The facet-model-based surface detection method uses facet model to estimate the local 3D directional derivatives and location of the zeros of the second 3D directional derivatives along the direction of gradient. Subvoxel accuracy can be achieved using this method. The morphology-based method performs a 3D dilation-erosion residue operation first. Then the zero crossings of the residue result images are detected, and the surface points are extracted. The wavelet-based method performs a 3D wavelet transform on the CT images, and the local maxima of the gradient are detected and marked as surface points. The performances of these surface detectors are compared. Finally, as an illustration, we apply the facet-model-based method on a set of engine blade CT images with resolution of 5 mil×5 mil and the measurements of thickness of wall are taken. A linear regression model is used to correct the systematic error. The results are very close to the direct optical measurements of cut-up sections of the blade with a maximum error of 3 mil.},

	abstract = {The appeal of the LTCC (low temperature cofired ceramic) process lies in the possibility of creating multilayer (3D) structures, integrating conductor paths between passive elements, such as inductors, resistors, and resonance cavities. Unfortunately, the very nature of a cofired device makes postflring optical inspection of buried elements impossible, as the ceramic material is opaque to visible light. This limitation, however, does not exist at x-ray wavelengths. The aim of this paper is to provide a practical overview of the application of high resolution x-ray imaging for nondestructive inspection and fault detection in multilayer LTCC structures. First, we present a simplified mathematical description of x-ray absorption inside an LTCC structure and demonstrate that due to the physical properties of the substrate (glass/Al 2O3 ceramic), the conductor material (silver), and the cavity fill (air), a high contrast image of the investigated structure can be obtained. Next, we show the application of a commercial off the shelf Industrial x-ray system for imaging various faults in LTCC structures, such as via voids (caused by inadequate filling of a via hole with conductor material), microcracks, paste creep (during lamination, excess via conductor leaks out of the via hole and in between the tape layers, shorting the via to an adjacent circuit), interruptions in conductor paths, and alignment errors. We also demonstrate the application of computed tomography to verify 3D geometry of buried resonance cavities and detect tape delaminations. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the method, related to structure thickness (number of layers), material composition, imaging geometry, and equipment characteristics, such as detector resolution and spatial noise. © 2011 International Microelectronics And Packaging Society.},

This non-destructive technology is suitable for collecting infrastructure inspection data related to 3D geometry and radiometry. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is traditionally used to measure pavement thickness, though this technique requires reference data (cores) when surveying in a ground-coupled configuration. Within this work, a new alternative method to GPR has been studied for determining pavement layer thicknesses and volumes. We analyze the performance of mobile LiDAR technology in this scope and test its accuracy compared to the results obtained with a ground-coupled 2.3-GHz GPR antenna. The findings presented here are based on field data collected from the Ourense-Celanova highway, in Northwestern Galicia.

Dermatologists use tactile inspection to subjectively assess the thickness by feeling the alteration of the lesion from its surrounding normal skin. In this paper, a method to objectively measure the abnormal elevation occurs in skin lesions is presented. A 3D fringe projection scanner is used to obtain 3D surface profile of the lesion. Thickness of a lesion is defined as the elevations of lesion surface from its lesion base. The lesion base is determined from the neighboring normal skin using a 3D surface interpolation technique. The lesion elevations are determined in a 3D space grid by subtracting the elevation of the lesion surface profile from the interpolated lesion base profile at all corresponding locations thus giving lesion thickness as the average value of the elevations. The algorithm has been validated using 3D surface samples with an error of 0.031 mm ±SD 0.014 mm (95% Confidence Interval: ±0.0011 mm). The validated algorithm has been successfully applied to measure thicknesses of 450 psoriasis plaque lesions with severity level ranging from mild to severe and thickness ranging from 0.021 mm to 0.883 mm. From the measured thicknesses, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) thickness scores 0 to 4 are then determined using unsupervised K-means Clustering. © 2010 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Myocardial perfusion imaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is an established method for the detection and evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD). State-of-the-art SPECT scanners yield a large number of regional parameters of the left-ventricular myocardium (e.g., blood supply at rest and during stress, wall thickness, and wall thickening during heart contraction) that all need to be assessed by the physician. Today, the individual parameters of this multivariate data set are displayed as stacks of 2D slices, bull's eye plots, or, more recently, surfaces in 3D, which depict the left-ventricular wall. In all these visualizations, the data sets are displayed side-by-side rather than in an integrated manner, such that the multivariate data have to be examined sequentially and need to be fused mentally. This is time consuming and error-prone. In this paper we present an interactive 3D glyph visualization, which enables an effective integrated visualization of the multivariate data. Results from semiotic theory are used to optimize the mapping of different variables to glyph properties. This facilitates an improved perception of important information and thus an accelerated diagnosis. The 3D glyphs are linked to the established 2D views, which permit a more detailed inspection, and to relevant meta-information such as known stenoses of coronary vessels supplying the myocardial region. Our method has demonstrated its potential for clinical routine use in real application scenarios assessed by nuclear physicians. © 2008 IEEE.},

SAM is a non-destructive metrology technique which utilizes high frequency ultrasound to generate a microscopic image of the internal parts of a specimen. The goal of this project is to develop microscopic techniques for evaluating Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) for 3D-Interconnects. Preliminary data shows voids and other defects in the interface between bonded wafers as shown in Figure 1. Our SAM laboratory system operates at 230 MHz and has a spatial resolution of 5-10μm and focal length of 5.9mm on a silicon wafer. The spatial resolution and sampling depth depend on the ultrasonic frequency, sound velocity, focal length and diameter of piezoelectric crystal. Typically, the silicon wafers have a thickness of 775μm before they are bonded. Our initial work is focused on blanket wafers in order to develop the bonding process. The next step is to bond wafers with test die where the patterning obscures the interface. This paper will discuss the limitations of SAM and compare it to infrared microscopy which is another important imaging capability for 3D Interconnect.

	abstract = {This work presents a novel computer model which simulates the main magnetic flux (MMF) signal of prestressing strand subjected to a magnetic field. Magnetic inspection techniques have been shown to be effective in detecting hidden corrosion in embedded prestressing steel strand. However, such systems are not yet ready for field application. The development of computational models is a key step in making the technology practical. Magnetic behavior of prestressing steel strand is a feature that can be used to determine loss of mass or other defects in the strand. The magnitude of the MMF induced in the strand can be used to estimate the cross-sectional area of healthy steel in the strand. Thus, magnetic properties can be utilized to measure the amount of hidden corrosion in the strands embedded in prestressed bridges and, hence, be used to determine the capacity of the bridge. An MMF electromagnet-based sensor system was recently developed for corrosion detection using the same principle. 2D and 3D models of this sensor are developed using commercially available magnetic field simulation software. The models are validated using laboratory results from tests with prestressing strands using the MMF electromagnet-sensor system. A number of factors including diameter of the strand, thickness of the concrete cover, reluctance in the magnetic circuit and variations due to temperature rise that affect the magnitude of the induced magnetic field are considered. Accuracy of the model is compared with laboratory and theoretical values. The computational model can be used to estimate corrosion from field test results and advance the development of the MMF electromagnet-sensor system. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Toho Gas has completed development of the world's first inspection system applying the ultrasonic synthetic aperture method for welds in steel pipes used to carry gas (external diameter 200mm, pipe wall thickness 5.8mm). In recent years, ultrasonic phased-array technology and ultrasonic TOFD methods etc. have attracted attention. However, the ultrasonic synthetic aperture method Is an imaging technology that Is superior to these, as it can synthesize several thousands of wave form data at high speed, its image clarity is the best in the world. The four features of the system are (1) the ability to provide an image of the interior of a weld, (2) the ability to quantity incomplete root bead penetration, (3) automatic high speed collection of data, and (4) data base management capability. The ultrasonic synthetic aperture method simplifies defect judgments because it does not require that operators possess special qualifications and training. It can produce three-dimensional high picture quality data. It can be handled easily at work sites because it is portable.

	abstract = {Crack assessment in engineering structures relies first on accurate evaluation of the stress intensity factors. In recent years, a large work has been conducted in France by the Atomic Energy Commission to develop influence coefficients for surface cracks in pipes. However, the problem of embedded cracks in plates (and pipes) which is also of practical importance has not received so much attention. Presently, solutions for elliptical cracks are available either in infinite solid with a polynomial distribution of normal loading or in plate, but restricted to constant or linearly varying tension. This paper presents the work conducted at EDF R&D to obtain influence coefficients for plates containing an elliptical crack with a wide range of the parameters: relative size (2a/t ratio), shape (a/c ratio) and crack eccentricity (2e/t ratio where e is the distance from the center of the ellipse to the plate mid plane). These coefficients were developed through extensive 3D finite element calculations: 200 geometrical configurations were modeled, each containing from 18000 to 26000 nodes. The limiting case of the tunnel crack (a/c = 0) was also analyzed with 2D finite element calculation (50 geometrical configurations). The accuracy of the results was checked by comparison with analytical solutions for infinite solids and, when possible, with solutions for finite-thickness plates (generally loaded in constant tension). These solutions will be introduced in the RSE-M Code that provides rules and requirements for in-service inspection of French PWR components.},

Methods: A total of 20 children were included: 10 children with diagnosis of ametropic amblyopia, 10 normal sighted children. All subjects provided informed consent. Any one with known or suspected neurological condition and ocular injury were excluded from the study. Standard T1-weighted high-resolution anatomic scans with MPRAGE sequence were obtained for each subject. Before the data processing, we confirmed by visual inspection that all datasets were uncontaminated with head motion artifacts and the children had no brain lesions. We analyzed the 3-dimensional data using FreeSurfer software package. The whole analysis procedures included segmentation of white matter, tessellation of the gray/white matter junction, automatic correction of topological defects, inflation of the folded surface tessellation patterns and registration into an average spherical surface template. All the cortical thickness was smoothed with a 10 mm full width at half height Gaussian kernel to improve the SNR. After inflated the brain cortex of the patient and normal groups, gray matter volume in bilateral occipital lobe and ICV (the estimate total intracranial volume) were calculated. The statistic analyses of the data between these two groups were performed with the student t test. Results: There were no significant differences between the amblyopia group and the normal group in the GMV of the occipital lobe (P>0.05). Conclusion: Ametropic amblyopia children's GMV in occipital lobe have not changed. Through 3D anatomic datasets analysis, observing the morphological variation of the occipital lobe without invasive is possible.},

The nondestructive metrology of deep-etched structures with aspect ratio of >10 and patterns with lateral dimensions in the range up to 5 μm remains an challenge and can be overcome by destructive control. In this paper the inspection of TSV depth and critical dimensions (CD) of their opening were performed nondestructively by an industrial thickness measurement tool (UV-VIS spectral reflectometer). The possibilities and limits of in-line optical tools for the characterization of the high density TSV array of high aspect-ratio square vias with tapered profile in Si were examined. TSV with CD from 3 up to 7 μm, pitch in the range of 7-11 μm, and etch depth of 50-70 μm were investigated. The TSV depth was determined using the interference effect between reflected waves from the top and bottom surfaces of the TSV structures. The rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) is successfully applied to the analysis of the spectral reflectance for the determination of the TSV top and bottom CD and profile evaluation. It was shown that this method can be used for the monitoring of geometrical parameters of TSVs with dimensions from 3 μm and aspect ratios up to 17:1. The non-destructive measurement data provide excellent correlation with SEM results. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Cryoconite holes form on ice due to enhanced ablation around particles deposited on the surface, and are present in the ablation area of glaciers worldwide. Here we investigate the use of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) as a non-destructive method to monitor and map cryoconite holes. We compare GPR data obtained from the Jutulsessen blue ice area in Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, with modeled GPR data. The modeled GPR response to cryoconite holes is numerically calculated by solving Maxwell's equations with a 3D Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) scheme. The model includes a realistic shielded bowtie antenna and dimensions and constituent parameters of cryoconite holes excavated in the field. We have performed what-if scenarios with controlled variation of single parameters. We show that GPR can be used to determine the horizontal extent, depth and whether a cryoconite hole is frozen or contains liquid water, information unavailable from visual surface inspection. The cryoconite thickness can, for completely frozen holes, be determined to within a 1/4 of the GPR center frequency wavelength. The exact water content is not readily extractable because the GPR response is influenced by many other factors such as: cryoconite thickness, shape and roughness, as well as antenna ground coupling. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Intelligent inline inspections (ILI) are widely used to guarantee a safe operation of pipelines. The inline inspection provides reliable data in an economic way. Historically, magnetic flux leakage technology (MFL) was one of the main technologies applied in pipeline systems. Within the last few years some minor improvements have been introduced in the existing MFL tool fleets, mainly focusing on a higher resolution. Nevertheless, a general restriction based on the physical basics finally limits the sizing capabilities of corrosion defects, esp. for complex shaped defects. Ultrasonic (UT) is currently the most accurate and reliable In-Line Inspection technology available in the market. These UT ILI Tools record data while travelling through the entire pipeline from Launcher to Receiver. In most cases, the Pipeline Operator does not need to make major adjustments to their pipeline. The latest generation of UT tools offers high inspection velocities-consequently a reduction of medium flow and loss of production can be avoided. In addition, a very high resolution of transducers in axial and circumferential direction provides excellent input for accurate pressure calculations, e.g. based on Riverbottom profiles or even 3D Finite element modeling. Using UT as the inspection method greatly increases the confident level of the inspection survey results. This in turn will give Pipeline Operators a greater peace of mind that their true pipeline condition is known thereby reducing unnecessary and costly digs and repairs. The authors will present some basic background information about ultrasound inspection technologies. State of the art solutions are presented for crack and wall thickness tools. Combining different technologies in one tool offers additional benefit. One single inspection tool with corrosion and crack transducers enables pipeline operators to operate their system safe with a minimized impact. Finally, the authors will present some special solutions for high pressure deep water applications and multi diameter pipeline systems. Copyright © 2015 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Current inspection standards require an inspector to travel to a target structure site and visually assess the structure's condition. This approach is labor-intensive, yet highly qualitative. A less time-consuming and inexpensive alternative to current monitoring methods is to use a robotic system that could inspect structures more frequently, and perform autonomous damage detection. In this paper, a vision-based crack detection methodology is introduced. The proposed approach processes 2D digital images (image processing) by considering the geometry of the scene (computer vision). The crack segmentation parameters are adjusted automatically based on depth parameters. The depth perception is obtained using 3D scene reconstruction. This system extracts the whole crack from its background, where the regular edge-based approaches just segment the crack edges. This characteristic is appropriate for the development of a crack thickness quantification system. Experimental tests have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Considering that the crack thickness is usually very small, it can be taken as a `surface defect' with zero-thickness. The eddy current field perturbation due to the crack is described as the effect produced by an equivalent current dipole layer located on its surface and the dipole density is found by solving a boundary integral equation. By following a moment method scheme the probe impedance changes due to the crack are evaluated. Because the 3D problem has been reduced to a 2D one, the required computer memory and CPU time are greatly reduced. The numerical predictions are compared with experiments and good agreement is found.},

	abstract = {Due to increasing integration density, breakthrough improvements in the resolution achievable by a specific inspection method are of great interest to the 3D Integration community. This requirement is particularly driven by wafer bonding technologies that, in addition to mechanical 3D assembly, were also often used to form buried electrical chipto chip interconnects with bonding pitch dimensions on the order of 10 μm. Acoustic microscopy is a unique tool for nondestructive inspection of internal structures in opaque materials. However, in acoustics the achievable resolution is strongly dependent on the wavelength of the insonated signal, which varies dramatically with the acoustic wave velocity. In the current study bonded devices with electrical routings in the bonded interface were inspected using acoustic microscopy applying highly focussed ultrasonic transducers with acoustic frequencies ranging from 100 MHz up to 1 GHz. Samples inspected contained high density interconnects (10 6 per cm2) forming large area arrays (512 x 640) on 10 μm and 15 μm pitch. Depending on the thickness of the top-layer the acoustic frequency and focal length of the transducer was selected for imaging. With a resolution of approx. 1 μm acoustic imaging of the metal-links behind 5 μm of BCB and underfill was performed. Delaminations of the lateral links were detected without opening the mounted polymer layer. The delaminated links were confirmed by FIB cross-sectioning and highresolution SEM imaging. In addition voids in the underfill material (a low moisture absorption epoxy) have been detected through the top-die. In further experiments acoustic inspection of the interconnects between the two wafers have been performed at 100 MHz, 200 MHz and 400 MHz with focal lengths of 2 mm down to 200 μm. The trade-off between the achievable resolution, acoustic attenuation and the thickness of the top-die has to be taken into account when imaging at a 5 μm scale through opaque polymer materials. It is expected that semi-destructive preparation will be required in practical applications, namely thinning of the top-wafer to an appropriate thickness. However, for performing failure analysis the acoustic inspection of the interconnects and the detection of delaminations at the interfaces between the dielectrics, underfills and metals in the bonded devices will be greatly beneficial for guiding additional destructive imaging and analyses. © 2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Automatic dimensional inspection of 3D articles with high resolution and productivity is an urgent problem for industry and science. Using optical inspection methods, it is essential to take into account the influence of 3D bodies' extension on their Fraunhofer diffraction pattern and images. This influence strongly depends on the configuration of illumination, which therefore is fundamentally important. The previously suggested constructive method, based on the model of equivalent diaphragms, for calculation of diffraction phenomena by 3D bodies of constant thickness was developed for inclined plane and spherical illuminating waves. The equations describing the spatial spectra of a volumetric asymmetric edge and a 3D slit under plane inclined wave illumination have been obtained in analytical form. It was shown that the cross-selection of front and back faces of the volumetric slit occurs in the case of inclined illumination. The solution for diffraction phenomena by a volumetric slit under spherical wave illumination has been represented. In this case the simultaneous selection of either front or back faces of the 3D slit takes place. The obtained results can be applied for investigation of formation and high-frequency filtering images of 3D bodies of constant thickness. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is manufacturing of turbocharger engine jet blades made of nickel superalloys. Processes for producing molds and casting realized in a production line are special processes. It means that the results are known only after inspection of the finished product. There is lack of the methods and techniques of effective and efficient quality control of the work in stock, above all molds. Therefore, the unknown is the state ceramic mold for the precision casting, which resulting in risk of referral to a defective mold of the casting process and thus give the product does not comply, is eliminated in the final inspection. One method of reducing this risk is particularly thorough monitoring of all parameters of each process and keeping them in the desired operating point. Operating point is a set of parameters of processes. Such monitoring is possible with the commitment to the methods and techniques to automatically, without human intervention, data collection and processing methods appropriate for use in operational control. The paper presents results of research on the attitude to the problem of a special process. This change is the introduction to the process efficient and effective form of quality control tools in the course of its preparation. In this case, the method of photogrammetry, thermal imaging and computed tomography were used. With the infrared camera will be possible to determine the temperature field, the disorder in relation to the pattern indicates the type of defect.

	abstract = {The fatigue growth of a fiber reinforced composite laminate was characterized under thermal cycling using a combined experimental and computational investigation. Twenty-four ply composite laminates ([0 °12 / 90 °12]) are fabricated with a pre-existing delamination, and subjected to thermal cycling in an environmental chamber. The large mismatch in the coefficients of thermal expansion is used to grow an interlaminar crack at the interface of the 0° and 90° laminae. This thermal fatigue crack growth behavior is investigated for different amplitudes of temperature change (ΔT = 30-140 °C). The inspection of fracture surfaces, after completion of the fatigue tests, reveals an angled or kinked crack front growth with greater propagation distances near the free-surfaces/edges. Due to the non-uniform crack growth across the specimen thickness, three-dimensional finite element analyses are performed to investigate the fatigue growth mechanisms under thermal load. From the analysis, the energy release rate as well as the mixed-mode stress intensity factors is calculated and the variations of these fracture parameters are found to be consistent with the observed crack front configuration. Using the computed results, the experimentally measured crack growth rates are also correlated with the amplitude of energy release rate, and a power law form of the fatigue law is established. The relevant coefficients as well as the threshold energy release rate are also determined. The present analysis is useful for not only understanding the fatigue delamination mechanisms under thermal cycling but also for estimating the threshold temperature variation that is needed to drive crack growth. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {We present a novel real-time method for the 3D reconstruction of the guidewire using a monoplane X-ray. The method consists of two steps: (1) the backprojection step to reconstruct a 3D surface that contains the guidewire and (2) the optimization step to select a curve on the surface that is the best match under the pre-specified constraints. The proposed method utilizes a priori knowledge in the form of a volume that indicates positions of the blood vessels and thus restricts the reconstruction. The reconstruction precision is limited by the local thickness of the vessels. The method is quantitatively evaluated on five phantom datasets and qualitatively on two patient datasets. For the phantom datasets the average reconstruction error is resolution limited to 1-2 voxels and is biased in the depth direction. The worst-case reconstruction error for any point, including the guidewire tip, is not larger than the local vessel thickness. A visual inspection of results for the patient datasets shows the guidewire is always placed in the proper vessel and is aligned with the 2D image, which is sufficient for the guidewire navigation. The developed implementation achieves the processing speed of 12. fps using Core™i7 CPU 920 at 2.67. GHz. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Inspection of aerospace components has always been a challenge. Lock-in thermography is an active technique which is popularly being used for the nondestructive evaluation of subsurface defects in composite materials such as carbon-fiber-reinforcedpolymer (CFRP) in aircraft structures. CFRP-foam layered structure composite is often used for anti-heat and adiabatic material in aerospace components. In this paper, a finite element analysis (FEA) of 3D heat conduction is developed in order to investigate the behavior of thermal waves in the CFRP-foam layered structure plates with finite thickness under convective and radiate conditions. The FEA simulation is then utilized to predict the magnitude and phase differences produced by CFRP face-sheet subsurface defects to obtain the optimum inspection parameters. The simulation results are compared with the experimental data. The use of optimum inspection parameters of lock-in thermography to detect PVC modeling defects of CFRP-foam layered structure is also presented in this paper.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) permits 3-dimensional (3D) cardiac imaging with high soft tissue contrast. X-ray fluoroscopy provides high-resolution, 2-dimensional (2D) projection imaging. We have developed real-time x-ray fused with MRI (XFM) to guide invasive procedures that combines the best features of both imaging modalities. We tested the accuracy of XFM using external fiducial markers to guide endomyocardial cell injections in infarcted swine hearts. METHODS AND RESULTS - Endomyocardial injections of iron-labeled mesenchymal stromal cells admixed with tissue dye were performed in previously infarcted hearts of 12 Yucatan miniswine (weight, 33 to 67 kg). Features from cardiac MRI were displayed combined with x-ray in real time to guide injections. During 130 injections, operators were provided with 3D surfaces of endocardium, epicardium, myocardial wall thickness (range, 2.6 to 17.7 mm), and infarct registered with live x-ray images to facilitate device navigation and choice of injection location. XFM-guided injections were compared with postinjection MRI and with necropsy specimens obtained 24 hours later. Visual inspection of the pattern of dye staining on 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride-stained heart slices agreed (κ=0.69) with XFM-derived injection locations mapped onto delayed hyperenhancement MRI and the susceptibility artifacts seen on the postinjection T2*-weighted gradient echo MRI. The distance between the predicted and actual injection locations in vivo was 3.2±2.6 mm (n=64), and 75% of injections were within 4.1 mm of the predicted location. CONCLUSIONS - Three-dimensional to two-dimensional registration of x-ray and MR images with the use of external fiducial markers accurately targets endomyocardial injection in a swine model of myocardial infarction. © 2006 American Heart Association, Inc.},

	abstract = {This paper proposed a method of microfabrication for the formation of hemispherical refractive microlenses by depositing a colloid evaporative droplet onto hydrophobic surfaces. The microdroplets made of polyurethane (PU) were self-driven by surface tension to evolve their three-dimensional (3D) shapes on the surface-treated substrate. The substrates were coated with low surface energy material (Teflon) to de-pin the fluids obeying classic Young-Laplace equation until drying. Array and size-variation experiments, corresponding to different placement and droplet volume, were performed for the shaping process in which the polymers of the drops were self-assembled to be hemispherical utilizing general principle of minimal surface energy. Using the hydrophobic surfaces, plano-convex shapes with spherical curvature were fabricated with micrometer dimensions (base radius between 70 and 1016 μm). The formed structures were observed to form themselves hemispherically by the de-wetting (de-pinning) process during most of evaporation. Moreover, the gravity flatting effect was further found for the larger drop (radius = 1016 μm) when compared to that of smaller one (radius = 118 μm). In the cases, both the modeling calculations and experimental results were performed and compared to illustrate the similar geometries with the contact angle (∼70°) using dimensionless analysis. In addition, one interesting and significant finding, based on close morphological inspection of the SEM picture, showed that the resulting elongational polymer chains (width ∼200 nm) stretched (extension ∼5 μm) on the surface nearby the corner of the contact area, indicating a shear stress occurrence. Compared to those previous methods operated on (soft-) photolithographic techniques, this present one could rapidly predict and microfabricate the hemispherical formation in terms of the radius, height, and contact angle. It is also potentially appropriate for smaller and complex placement by using drop-on-demand (DOD) nozzle arrays for mass-production process. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Longitudinal critically refracted (LCR) waves are employed to measure the welding residual stresses while outer and inner surfaces of the pipe are inspected by using different frequency range of ultrasonic transducers. The acoustoelastic constant is measured on a plate with the same material and thickness of the investigated pipe to keep the pipe intact. Welding process of the pipe is simulated by a 3D finite element (FE) model which is validated by hole-drilling method performed on 25 points. The residual stresses calculated by FE simulation are then compared with those obtained from the ultrasonic measurement while a good agreement is observed.

	abstract = {Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is one of high resolution geophysical methods for locating missed objects, buried equipments. GPR is a nondestructive testing method that is useful in various kinds of explorations such as mapping the archaeological sites. The safety of the archaeological sites is one of the most concerns of the archaeologists. One of the best GPR applications is in archaeology as a non-destructive exploration method. This method uses high frequency electromagnetic waves or Radio Frequency range (12.5 2300 MHz) to investigate the subsurface and detecting underground objects. It is used to measure features such as depth of the buried anomalies, layers thickness, moisture content, horizontal cracks, voids and hidden objects. The electromagnetic waves reflected from the interfaces in the subsurface are used to analyze the structure of the area under scan. The electromagnetic waves are emitted from an antenna that is not necessarily in direct contact with the earth surface. The same antenna can be used to record the reflected energy stemming from the dielectrical interfaces. The penetration depth of the GPR technique varies with acquisition and subsurface conditions. The data gathering procedure can be designed in two or three dimensions. If the target is such as pipe or the pre-known target, the data gathering can be done in 2D. But if the target is completely unknown, especially as the matter of its place, the three dimensional data grid will be more useful and accurate. The GPR signals diffract when they contact the anomalies. The anomalies seem as hyperboles in sections. With these hyperboles in the sections, accurate detection of anomaly's depth and other properties are impossible. For solving this problem, a processing method should be applied. The processing methods vary depends on the different goals. Using various processing methods with parameters can be applied for different purposes. The operator's ability in choosing the proportionate parameters is as important as choosing an appropriate processing algorithm to aim for an acceptable image. Although in some special conditions, some processing may cause unwanted problems in data. This paper contains investigations in an archaeological site in Kerman Province, Iran. The exact location of the site is in the middle of the Kerman city, the capital of the Province. The antenna which has been used was a 500 MHz GPR antenna, made by MALA. The target was the remains of one the most important and also old schools of Iran which had been buried under the soil for hundreds of years. On the top of the data collection areas, where had been specified by the archeologists, some houses and buildings had been made. The data gathering procedure in the mentioned area was a three dimensional one. The data were collected in 2009. The Reflex 3D software was used for the processing and the depth estimation of the acquisitioned data. Regarding the properties of the target in the study area, the processing algorithms can be different from case to case. For example, the data filtering that is usually being used for windowing the environmental noises in some cases, is sufficient for bolding the subsurface reflections. Although in some other cases, more and complicated levels of processing are needed. The whole processing algorithm depends on the land's properties, the GPR instruments, the softwares and mainly the data gathering methods. So, in all of the cases not all of the processing levels are necessarily needed. Perhaps in some situations, some of the processing levels are not useful and may cause the operator unwanted difficulties in the data sections. In this paper, the needed processing levels in archaeological cases were studied, and also the results on the Kerman area have been presented. The gain filter was the most sufficient processing step in the processing algorithms. The changing of different parameters in this filter caused the most clear improvement in the results and for making the anomaly's source known. So, in the cases that the depth range of anomaly's source had been guessed by the experts or the other methods and the archaeological areas, a proper gain filter was recommended. One of the other methods that will be so useful in making the anomalies more clear in the GPR sections is the amplitude limitation. The results of applying this method are shown in this paper. The unwanted amplitudes are trouble-making in the GPR anomaly interpretations. The amplitude limitation helps the operator and the interpreter to distinguish the main anomalies from the environmental noises. The Dewow processing step is also one of the steps which will decrease the near surface or air signals between the transmitter and the receiver. As conclusion, two mentioned processing methods above, namely the gain filter and amplitude limitation, were used as two major parts of processing algorithms and helped the exploration team to clarify the source's exact coordination.},

	abstract = {Adhesively bonded stiffeners are employed in aerospace applications to increase structural stiffness. The potential of feature-guided wave modes for the verification of adhesion and curing state in difficult-to-access regions has been investigated. The properties of guided wave modes propagating along a T-shaped stiffener bonded to an aluminium plate were calculated using the Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) method. Feature-guided modes dominated by shearing motion were identified to be well suited, with energy concentrated at the stiffener and bond line, limiting energy radiation into the plate and thus maximising inspection length. The influences of the bond line stiffness and thickness on the guided wave behaviour were investigated using SAFE and 3D Finite Element calculations, and found to be significant. Experiments were conducted to measure the properties of the guided waves during the curing of an epoxy joint attaching a stiffener to a plate. The feature-guided mode was excited using a piezo-electric shear transducer and measured using a laser interferometer. The measured phase speed changed significantly during curing. The frequency dependency was found to match well with the SAFE calculations for a variation of the shear (Coulomb) modulus of the adhesive. The potential of the feature-guided shear wave mode for bond line inspection and monitoring has been shown and the choice of guided wave mode and frequency range for good sensitivity to the bond line state discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Electric rail vehicles use current collection system which consists of overhead contact line and a current collector (pantograph) mounted on the roof of a vehicle. A pantograph is equipped with contact strips, which slide along the contact wire, ensuring steady electric contact. Contact strips are made of carbon layer, fixed to an aluminum carrier. The carbon layer wears down due to friction. Using overly worn contact strips increases the rate of contact wire wear and, significantly, the risk of contact line damage. Therefore, thickness of carbon strips has to be inspected periodically. In previous work a 3D-scanning system has been proposed for recording data of contact strips when vehicles pass an inspection point on a railway line. However, the system has to be complemented with data analysis algorithm to estimate the thickness of the carbon layer. Data processing has to be performed quickly and automatically to prevent faulty pantographs from being used. The main difficulty of wear analysis is caused by diverse altitude and tilt of scanned contact strips. To determine the smallest thickness of carbon layer, the carbon surface data have to be normalized with respect to an aluminum carrier. The location and shape of the aluminum carrier can be extracted from the registered data. Due to the fact that the profile of the carrier is highly distorted, a robust Whittaker approximation algorithm has been proposed in order to deal with the noise and the missing data. © 2014 IEEE.},

A thermal-numerical model based on the 3D transient heat conduction equation for heterogeneous media is proposed to model the thermal response of the composite medium when a thermal pulse is applied to its surface. The solution of the model is developed using the finite volume method, in which the approximated equations are obtained by performing energy balances for each elementary volume. The experimental validation of the thermal-numerical model consisted of a comparison of the thermal decay curves for defective areas obtained through numerical simulation and with a pulsed thermography inspection of a laminated composite specimen with simulated defects (Teflon inserts). A parametric study was carried out in order to analyze the influence of the irradiation power density, non-uniform heating and characteristics associated with the defects on quantitative variables such as the onset time and thermal contrast. Numerical results showed that the variable thermal contrast is highly sensitivity to changes in the defect thickness, aspect ratio and parameters related to the external stimulation. Furthermore, an increase in the detectability of defects - especially those with lower aspect ratios - can be achieved by increasing the irradiation power. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The main issues of our laboratorial prototype arise from the use of a linear image sensor taking advantage of its geometry to achieve lower acquisition time in comparison to traditional (pinhole) confocal approach. The use of a slit-detector is normally related to resolution degradation for details parallel to sensor. But an improvement will surely arise using light distribution along line pixels of the sensor which establishes a great advantage in comparison to (pure) slit detectors. The versatility of this bench-microscope affords excellent means to develop and test algorithms. Those to improve lateral resolution isotropy as well as image visualization and 3D mesh reconstruction under different setups namely illumination modes. Based on the results of these tests tests both wide-field illumination and parallel slit illumination and detection configurations were used in these two applications. Results from IC wire-bonding show the ability of the system to extract 3D information. A comparison of auto-focus images and 3D profiles obtained using different 3D reconstruction algorithms as well as a method for the determination of the diameter of the bond wire are presented. Measurements of PCB track width and thickness were performed and the comparison of these results from both longitudinal and transverse tracks stress the limitations of a lower spatial sampling rate induced by the resolution of object stage positioners. © 2013 SPIE.},

	abstract = {Crack assessment in engineering structures relies first on accurate evaluation of the stress intensity factors. In recent years, a large work was conducted in France by the Atomic Energy Commission to develop influence coefficients for surface cracks in pipes. However, the problem of embedded cracks in plates (and pipes), which is also of practical importance, has not received so much attention. Presently, solutions for elliptical cracks are available either in infinite solid with a polynomial distribution of normal loading or in plate, but restricted to constant or linearly varying tension. This paper presents the work conducted at EDF R&D to obtain influence coefficients for plates containing an elliptical crack with a wide range of the parameters: relative size (2a/t ratio), shape (a/c ratio) and free surface proximity (a/d ratio, where d is the distance from the center of the ellipse to the closest free surface). These coefficients were developed through extensive 3D finite element calculations: 200 geometrical configurations were modeled, each containing from 18,000 to 26,000 nodes. The limiting case of the tunnel crack (a/c = 0) was also analyzed with 2D finite element calculation (50 geometrical configurations). The accuracy of the results was checked by comparison with analytical solutions for infinite solids and, when possible, with solutions for finite-thickness plates (generally loaded in constant tension). These solutions have been introduced in the RSE-M Code that provides rules and requirements for in-service inspection of French PWR components. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Integrity of pipelines is of vital importance to their performance. This entails routine inspection using a variety of different inspection tools. One of the most popular type of tools is based upon Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL). In this technique, the MFL tool magnetically saturates the pipe and in locations where defects exist, flux leaks out of the pipe and is detected by a set of on-board sensors. There are two different geometric configurations of an MFL tool, namely, axial and circumferential. Understanding the magnetic behaviour of these tools is critical if the MFL technique is to be successful. This paper details 2D and 3D finite element (FE) modelling of a circumferential magnetiser at rest and at typical operating speeds. 2D modelling of a stationary MFL tool indicates that pipe saturation can occur for a variety of pipe dimensions provided the magnets are correctly sized. However, this 2D modelling assumes a constant cross-sectional area and thus neglectes tool end effects. This is rectified by the creation of several 3D models. It can be seen from these 3D models that end effects are significant and that pipe saturation is not as easily achieved as it was in 2D. Further, it is shown that when the MFL tool moves at constant speed down the pipe, the magnetic field profile in the pipe observed under stationary conditions is significantly altered. The significance of this effect depends on the operational speed of the tool, the material properties of the pipe and the dimensions of the pipe (pipe diameter and wall thickness). The 3D modelling presented suggests that under certain conditions the level of flux in the pipe is less than ideal (i.e. lacking the required magnetic intensity and homogeneity) and, for these conditions, the circumferential MFL technique may have difficulty detecting and sizing pipe anomalies.

Modal studies are carried out using the Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) method, while 3D finite element (FE) simulations are used to gain visualization of results and also obtain cross-validation. Our studies reveal, perhaps for the first time, the possibility of bend-guided modes of the shear-horizontal (SH) family, in addition those of the Rayleigh-Lamb family reported earlier in the literature. This mode has attractive properties including low attenuation and limited dispersion. We investigate effects of plate thickness and bend radius on the physics of FGW in bends, arguing the strong role of geometry and curvature effects in causing mode confinement. Experiments have also been carried out to validate the existence of such bend-guided mode. Copyright © 2015 by DEStech Publica tions, Inc.},

	abstract = {Airway wall remodeling in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a well-known indicator of the pathology. In this context, current clinical studies aim for establishing the relationship between the airway morphological structure and its function. Multislice computed tomography (MSCT) allows morphometric assessment of airways, but requires dedicated segmentation tools for clinical exploitation. While most of the existing tools are limited to cross-section measurements, this paper develops a fully 3D approach for airway wall segmentation. Such approach relies on a deformable model which is built up as a patient-specific surface model at the level of the airway lumen and deformed to reach the outer surface of the airway wall. The deformation dynamics obey a force equilibrium in a Lagrangian framework constrained by a vector field which avoids model self-intersections. The segmentation result allows a dense quantitative investigation of the airway wall thickness with a deeper insight at bronchus subdivisions than classic cross-section methods. The developed approach has been assessed both by visual inspection of 2D cross-sections, performed by two experienced radiologists on clinical data obtained with various protocols, and by using a simulated ground truth (pulmonary CT image model). The results confirmed a robust segmentation in intra-pulmonary regions with an error in the range of the MSCT image resolution and underlined the interest of the volumetric approach versus purely 2D methods. © 2011 SPIE.},

For the efficient application in the field, the capabilities of the different methods in solving a specific testing problem have to be known. In a research project funded by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) a first stage facility for the calibration and validation of NDT methods has been established. A test frame with two automated scanners has been designed and built, in which concrete blocks with artificial defects or testing problems can be tested by NDT methods such as ultrasonic-echo, impact-echo, covermeter or Ground Penetrating Radar. The most relevant testing problems dealt with in this project are the location of reinforcement steel, tendon duct inspections and thickness measurements. Furthermore, the capabilities and limitations of NDT methods in determining elastic parameters have also been investigated. 2D and 3D imaging techniques as well as signal processing such as the Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique (SAFT) applied to the data provide a vivid representation of the results and make the interpretation easier and more intuitive.

	abstract = {Incremental forming is one of the manufacturing methods which uses relative simple technological equipment and can assure a high rate of the process’ flexibility. These requirements can assure the efficiency demanded by the industrial market, in the case of small production batches, which occur more and more often nowadays. To ensure the stability of the process, the required quality and dimensional accuracy of the parts have to be well controlled. This requires the evaluation of the part’s dimensions by certain measurements. For hollow parts, the measurement of their thickness is always a challenge, mainly when the dimensions are smaller and their depth is greater. This paper presents a digital method for the part’s dimensional evaluation and analysis, which can be very accurate and does not need mechanical contacts with the part during measurements. The parts were scanned with a 3D blue light scanner, on their both sides and then the data was processed into specialized software, to obtain the part’s digital surface from the 3D scanned data. The digital data was compared with the theoretical approach, to establish some conclusions on the validity of the sinus law and to point out the critical zones, where the thinning is strong and may cause fractures. The digital scanning method presented can be used also for quality control and inspection, as the processing steps are considered user-friendly and easy to adapt to certain specific requirements. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on imaging and scanning technology based on the rolling Impact Echo Scanning (IES) method. The background of the Impact Echo technique and its implementation with a rolling scanning transducer are discussed herein. 2D and 3D displays using the amplitude normalization and thickness surface plot techniques including typical results in time and frequency domains from a US National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) research project are included with this paper along with a case history from a post-tensioned segmental bridge. Impact Echo is generally used to either determine the internal condition of the concrete structures or measure the thickness of the structures. The rolling transducer in the IE Scanner expedites the IE test process by allowing for rapid, near-continuous testing. In field bridge investigations, ducts are typically located using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR). Then an Impact Echo Scanner was used to scan along and across ducts for internal grout condition evaluations. The results from Impact Echo scanning were processed with an automatic filtering including a bandpass filter to remove ambient noise and a bandstop filter to remove the undesired rolling noise frequency. This technique produced good accuracy in locating voids in steel ducts in the bridge. A sensitivity study was conducted for Styrofoam voids of varying size in 100 mm diameter ducts in a full-scale bridge girder in the NCHRP research. Honeycomb void was also imaged with IES in the research. The 2D display Impactechogram and 3D display of surface plot data helps in data interpretation by enhancing the visualization and interpretation of the test results. The NDE results from IES tests of post-tensioned steel ducts in a post-tensioned segmental bridge are also discussed. Destructive drilling and further inspection by videoscope were performed on these ducts to confirm their actual conditions. Results from the IES show good agreements with the results from the videoscope observations in drillholes. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Pipe elbow is a common feature in pipelines and piping systems as a means to changing directions of otherwise straight pipelines. Irrespective of the processes involved in manufacturing pipe elbows, it is of interest to investigate whether they have any geometric imperfections. Researchers at the University of Alberta have devised a technique to measure initial imperfection of straight pipes prior to testing, using high resolution 3D surface profiler in conjunction with 3D reverse engineering software. The objective of the current study is to extend the imperfections measurement technique from measuring straight pipe segments to pipe elbows. Six (6) ninety (90) degree elbows are measured in this research with outside diameters ranging from NPS 12 inch to NPS 42 inch. A 3D laser scanner is used to acquire surface data and create 3D models corresponding to each elbow. A method for the geometric analysis of the elbows is developed using 3D inspection and reverse engineering software Geomagic®. The geometric idealization of a pipe elbow is a torus, which can be defined by a circle revolving around an axis, coplanar with the circle. The idealized geometry for each elbow is obtained through the developed method of geometric analysis, which includes the diameter of the circle defining the torus, and its distance from the axis of revolution. The difference between the ideal torus and the scanned geometry is considered as imperfection of each pipe elbow. The wall thickness values at the ends or edges of select pipe elbows are also measured from the scanned data and are reported as percentage deviation from the specified wall thickness around the perimeter at different cross sections. The 3D reverse engineering of the elbows indicated that they resemble the ideal geometry very closely. The ovalization imperfections are seen to be well within the value specified by CSA Z662-11. The wall thickness deviations are seen to vary between -10% to +25% of the specified value, with increased thickness being more prominent in the elbows. Finite element analysis of an elbow with thickness imperfection shows that higher hoop stress appears on the intrados than initially intended. Copyright © 2014 by ASME.},

Using the optical inspection methods, it is essential to take into account the influence of 3D bodies'extension on their Fraunhofer diffraction pattern and images. This influence strongly depends on the configuration of illumination, which therefore is fundamentally important. The solution for diffraction phenomena by volumetric slit under inclined plane and spherical wave illumination has been represented. The obtained results can be applied for investigation of formation and high-frequency filtering images of 3D bodies of constant thickness. Ensuring the safety and high operation reliability of nuclear reactors takes 100% inspection of geometrical parameters of fuel assemblies, which include the spacer grids performed as cellular structure with fuel elements. The required spacer grids geometry of assembly in the transverse and longitudinal cross sections is extremely important for maintaining the necessary heat regime. A universal method for 3D spacer grid inspection using the diffractive optical element, which generates as the structural illumination, a multiple-ring pattern on the inner surface of a spacer grid cell is investigated. Using some diffractive optical elements one can inspect the nomenclature of all produced grids. Experimental results for semi-industrial version of spacer grid inspection system are presented.

The effects of initial imperfections should be considered to avoid over estimation of load carrying capacity of pipes. Various methods of taking physical measurements of initial imperfections have been developed previously. These methods are error prone, time consuming, only applicable to short pipe segments, and yield limited number of measured dimensions. The objective of the current study is to devise a more efficient and accurate method for quantifying initial imperfections. A 3D laser scanner is used for fast acquisition of a high density set of points on the pipe surface. Acquired data is then exported to a 3D inspection and reverse engineering software for analysis. Deviation of the pipe diameter is measured with respect to an ideal pipe with constant diameter. Ovalization is measured along the length of the pipe and thickness variation is measured near the pipe edge. Changes in the geometry of the seam weld along the pipe length are also observed. Four different pipe segments were scanned and analyzed. Results of diameter and thickness variations are reported with respect to the location of the seam weld. Diameter variation shows a typical pattern in which the positions of maximum positive and negative deviations of diameter with respect to the seam weld are similar in all the pipes. The high density set of points enables us to arrive at larger volume of measurement results compared to previous methods. Based on this new technique of measurement, it is possible to develop a more accurate and applicable initial imperfections model for energy pipelines.},

	abstract = {The demand for product miniaturization, especially in the handheld device area, continues to challenge the board assembly industry. The desire to incorporate more functionality while making the product smaller continues to push board design to its limit. It is not uncommon to find boards with castle like components right next to miniature components. This type of board poses a special challenge to the board assemblers as it requires a wide range of paste volume to satisfy both small and large components. One way to address the printing challenge is to use creative stencil design to meet the solder paste requirement for both large and small components. Examples of stencil design include step stenciling, dual printing, over-size apertures, etc. The stencil printing process, at its most basic level, involves pushing solder paste through a stencil (with various size apertures) by a squeegee blade. As the squeegee blade and the stencil are in constant contact with the paste during the printing process, their surface characteristics play an important role in the printing process. The most important attribute of a stencil is its release characteristic. In other words, how well the paste releases from the aperture. The paste release, in turn, depends on the surface characteristics of the aperture wall and stencil foil. The recent introduction of a new technology, nano coating for both stencil and squeegee blades, has drawn the attention of many researchers. As the name implies, nano-coated stencils and blades are made by conventional method such as laser-cut or electoform then coated with nano-functional material to alter the surface characteristics. This study will evaluate nano-coated stencils for passive component printing, including 01005. Various print experiments will be conducted using different stencil technology, stencil thicknesses, aperture size, aperture orientation, aperture shapes, and selected paste type, with optimal print parameters to understand the effect of chosen factors on the print quality. Print quality will be determined by visual inspection and 3D measurement of the paste deposit to understand the volume transfer efficiency.},

	abstract = {Adhesively bonded stiffeners are employed in aerospace applications to increase structural stiffness. The potential of shear guided wave modes for the verification of adhesion and bond line thickness in difficult to access regions has been investigated. The properties of guided wave modes propagating along a T-shaped stiffener bonded to an aluminium plate were calculated using the Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) method. Shear modes were identified as well suited with energy concentrated at the stiffener and bond line, limiting energy radiation into the plate and thus achieving increased inspection length. The influence of bond line properties and thickness was investigated from SAFE and 3D Finite Element calculations and a significant influence of the epoxy shear (Coulomb) modulus on the phase velocity found. Experiments were conducted during the curing of an epoxy adhesive, bonding a stiffener to the plate with bond strength and stiffness increasing over time. The excited shear mode was measured using a laser interferometer. The measured phase velocity changed significantly during curing. The frequency dependency matches well with the SAFE calculations for a variation of the Coulomb's modulus of the adhesive layer. The potential of the shear guided wave mode for bond line inspection and monitoring has been shown. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {The structural integrity of a flap-track beam (FTB) made from non-crimp fabric composites and assembled using mechanical fasteners and adhesively bonded joints is investigated using full-scale experiments and numerical modeling. The FTB, being an aircraft structural component, has been selected as the verification structure and demonstrator of a novel material-driven design concept aiming to progressively replace mechanical fasteners by adhesively bonded joints and introduce fabric composites of enhanced through-thickness properties in aero-structures. For the sake of investigation, the FTB has been subjected to a combination of static and fatigue loading conditions taken from realistic load-scenarios. Due to size and complexity of the structure and testing demands, a special test-rig was developed for the occasion. During loading, the response of the structure has being fully monitored using a network of sensors along with an optical measurement system. After loading, the health of the structure was monitored using nondestructive inspection. Complementary to mechanical testing, a 3D detailed FE model was developed for virtual experimenting. On the basis of the model, progressive damage modeling has been implemented to simulate initiation and progression of composite failure as well as debonding. Both experiments and model have shown that the composite FTB is capable to effectively carry the load which the original fastened metallic FTB has been designed to carry. Localized damage that has no significant effect on the integrity of the structure has been detected at fastener areas and bonded joints containing initial defects. Between experiments and model a satisfactory agreement has been achieved considering the uncertainties in experimental procedure and numerical errors of the model. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Knowledge of tumor stage and grade is paramount for treatment decision making in cases of upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma but this condition cannot be accurately assessed by current techniques. Optical coherence tomography can hypothetically provide the urologist with real-time intraoperative information on tumor grade and stage. In this pilot study we report what are to our knowledge the first results of optical coherence tomography for grading and staging upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma. Materials and Methods: Eight consecutive patients underwent ureterorenoscopy for suspicion or followup of upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma. Optical coherence tomography data sets were intraoperatively obtained from the ureter and renal pelvis. All patients eventually underwent nephroureterectomy. Optical coherence tomography staging was done by visual inspection of lesions found on optical coherence tomography images. Optical coherence tomography grading was done by quantifying optical coherence tomography signal attenuation in mm -1 on lesions and comparing results with the histopathological diagnosis. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for statistical analysis. Results: For 7 in vivo optical coherence tomography diagnoses staging was in accordance with histology. In patient 8 tumor thickness transcended optical coherence tomography imaging depth range and, therefore, invasiveness findings were inconclusive. For grading the median attenuation coefficient for grade 2 and 3 lesions was 1.97 (IQR 1.57-2.30) and 3.53 mm-1 (IQR 2.74-3.94), respectively (p <0.001). Healthy urothelium was too thin to reliably determine the attenuation coefficient. Conclusions: Optical coherence tomography is a promising, minimally invasive tool for real-time intraoperative optical diagnosis of tumors in the upper urinary tract. Our results warrant future research in a larger sample size to determine the accuracy of grading and staging by optical coherence tomography, and its possible implementation in the diagnostic algorithm for upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma. © 2013 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare diagnostic accuracy of cone beam CT (CBCT) and multislice CT in artificially created fractures of the sheep mandibular condyle. Methods: 63 full-thickness sheep heads were used in this study. Two surgeons created the fractures, which were either displaced or non-displaced. CBCT images were acquired by the NewTom 3G® CBCT scanner (NIM, Verona, Italy) and CT imaging was performed using the Toshiba Aquillon® multislice CT scanner (Toshiba Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan). Twodimensional (2D) cross-sectional images and three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions were evaluated by two observers who were asked to determine the presence or absence of fracture and displacement, the type of fracture, anatomical localization and type of displacement. The naked-eye inspection during surgery served as the gold standard. Inter- and intra-observer agreements were calculated with weighted kappa statistics. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analyses were used to compare statistically the area under the curve (AUC) of both imaging modalities. Results: Kappa coefficients of intra- and interobserver agreement scores varied between 0.56 - 0.98, which were classified as moderate and excellent, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the imaging modalities, which were both sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of sheep condylar fractures. Conclusions: This study confirms that CBCT is similar to CT in the diagnosis of different types of experimentally created sheep condylar fractures and can provide a cost- and doseeffective diagnostic option. © 2010 The British Institute of Radiology.},

	abstract = {Since 9/11 there has been a growing interest to improve the security both of air travel and of cargo shipping. Visual inspection is the simplest tool and is very efficient, when single objects of small size are to be checked. The complexity of inspection increases as we have large "boxes" and when several objects are packed into a closed space, such as in a luggage or even in larger volumes like shipping containers or trucks. An obvious method to check these objects is using x-rays, which can penetrate through the shipping "boxes" and let us see what is inside. It is well known that the x-ray absorption of an object depends on the absorption coefficient and the thickness of a given material. So X-ray is an excellent tool to check luggage without opening and manually checking each of them. This paper gives an overview of different x-ray luggage inspection techniques from simple transmission imaging to multi-energy and 3D x-ray computer tomography (CT). However, none of the x-ray imaging methods give a full differentiation between a plastic explosive and a bag of flour of the same shape. X-ray diffraction is a more sophisticated method to differentiate materials with and without crystalline structure and among materials of different crystalline structures. There is also a real danger that not only traditional explosives but nuclear materials can be smuggled into the US in cargo containers and trucks. Not only the explosion of a nuclear bomb but also a so called "dirty bomb" could cause death and panic in large cities. So to check the containers before they enter the country, for explosives and especially for nuclear materials is a primary goal. As it was mentioned earlier the x-ray absorption of the materials depends on the x-ray energy. Higher energy mega-electronvolt x-rays can penetrate through thick steels and other highly absorbent materials. This makes it possible to check the content of shipping containers or trucks with steel walls in the loading area. The theory and limits of high energy x-ray imaging, dual energy x-ray imaging, and high energy CT are also demonstrated. A further application using x-rays is back scatter imaging.

	abstract = {A new interconnection technique has been developed that allows versatile multiple strand connections between microsensors, sensor arrays, and chips designed for wire bonding. The new technique has been termed 'microflex interconnects' (MFI). Conventional wire bonding technique is commonly restricted to planar interconnects with a limited degree of freedom for placing microsystem components. The MFI technique has overcome this limitation by interconnecting microsystem components through custom designed flexible foils with embedded metallized conductors. The MFI foils may also serve as circuit substrates. This basic foil material is polyimide (Du Pont PI 2611) or BCB which are patterned photolithographically. Platinum, gold or either conductive metals are sputtered or evaporated on the foil and patterned using lift-off technique. Several metallization layers can be embedded in the material. Pitch and shape of the MFI contact pads correspond to the one of the chips to be interconnected. A via hole is placed in the center of the MFI contact pads. MFI pads and chip pads are adjusted. Metal balls or wedges generate the electrical and mechanical contact through the vias between the chips and the MFI substrate. An commercial wire bonder is the only equipment needed to perform the MFI method. The MFI technique was applied to bond standard CMOS integrated circuit bond pads with a width of 30 micrometers and a pitch of 70 micrometers to a 10 micrometers thick MFI foil. The integration density of the of the MFI technique correspond to one of the flip- chip technology. Special advantages of the MFI technique are 3D interconnects, the flexibility in design and shape, and easy visual inspection of alignment qualities. The MFI method is also suited for biomedical applications because all materials used are biocompatible. ©2003 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.},

	abstract = {This study applies two image-dependent restoration filters to projection image sets obtained with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Wiener and Metz restoration of combined conjugate views are compared to: 1)each other, 2)Wiener restoration of individual projection images, and 3)to one-dimensional (1D) Butterworth smoothing. The combined view restoration filters adapt to the average thickness of the object by estimating a modulation transfer function (MTF) for that thickness. Simulated Tc-99m liver-spleen studies with randomly placed “cold spot tumors”, a projector which accounts for the spatially variant blurring in SPECT, and a Poisson noise generator are used to compute simulated projection image sets. These sets are filtered and reconstructed using Tanaka's method of intrinsic attenuation correction. Cold spot contrast, automated receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis of cold spot detectability, and the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) are used to compare the four processing methods. Little difference is noted between the three restoration methods. However, the restoration filters all yield noticeably better ROC and NMSE results than the ID smoothing. Inspection of the three-dimensional (3D) MTF derived from reconstructions of point sources indicates that the restoration filters substantially reduce the low-frequency degradation which is primarily due to scatter.

	abstract = {In order to recalculate the strength capacity of a high-pressure thick-wall pipeline subjected to the pitting corrosion process, the traditional algorithm assumes a new wall thickness obtained simply by subtraction the depth of the deepest corrosion pit, found during a pipeline inspection, from the designed pipe-wall thickness. This philosophy does not account for strength disturbances in the proximity of corrosion pit, coming from different stress fields in the pipe-wall external sub-layer, containing the corrosion pit, and in the rest of the pipe-wall. The recalculation of pipe-wall strength can be obtained in on of two approaches of modelling of the pitting corrosion effect. The first one is represented by a 2D-model and differs from the second one, more realistic 3D-model, in both the simplicity and accuracy of the solution. The paper presents the first results of numerical analysis (2D finite-element model) of the strength of pipe-wall with a corroded external surface, and compares them with results obtained from the traditional way of treating of the governing problem.},

WIT uses various computed tomography (CT) methods for both NDE and NDA of nuclear waste drums. Without opening waste drums, WIT inspects and characterizes radioactive waste, including low level (LLW), transuranic (TRU), and mixed waste. With externally transmitted x-ray NDE techniques, WIT has the ability to identify high density waste materials like heavy metals, define drum contents in 2D and 3D space, quantify free liquid volumes through density and x-ray attenuation coefficient discrimination, and measure drum wall thickness. With waste emitting gamma-ray NDA techniques, WIT can locate gamma emitting radioactive sources in 2D and 3D space, identify gamma emitting isotopic species, identify gamma emitting isotopic species, identify the extermal activity approximations, and provide the data needed for waste classification as LLW or TRU.},

The x-ray tube and the detector are set on the same side of the object. Thus, non-destructive evaluation of the wall of a tank, even when it is full, is possible without the requirement for the x-ray beam to cross the whole object. Several applications were tried in our laboratory. Besides 3D imaging, a method allowing thickness measurement of a wall was developed, which was especially suitable for multilayer compounds. The accuracy is ±0.01 mm. Compton scattering techniques also allow point-by-point density measurements in the near-surface zone of any component (even dense and bulky ones). An accuracy of 1% was achieved for light composite materials and also for dense components (p ≈ 6.5) provided by powder metallurgy. A new application allows us to perform 3D imaging using a linear accelerator (6 MeV) as the photon source. Thus, testing can be performed inside a tank, even through a thick and dense wall (8 mm of steel).},

	abstract = {The visuell inspection of printed circuit boards (PCB's) by human controllers is still an often applied method. However, increasing complexity of electronic fine pitch devices and application of spatial modules makes this way of testing more and more problematic and some defect characteristics can't be judged only by visual inspection systems. A typical example is the testing of SMD solder joints, which can be checked properly only by x-ray methods. In this paper the recently developed x-ray system 3D-DELTA (3-dim. Defect Localization and depht Analysis) for automatic PCB testing is presented. The system was developed for faster spatial data extraction by use of only two x-ray images of the PCB's. The result is the 3-dimensional classification of defects within solder joints and of the solder joints itself without the use of complex computer tomographic algorithms. First the x-ray imaging system for data acquisition is shown. In order to achieve the required data for evaluation, two micro focus x-ray sources are used to produce a stereo image pair during one scan. The use of a line scanning x-ray detector allows the image acquisition line by line with contrast enhancement during object movement. Time loss by stop and go of the assembly line is avoided with this method. Second the data preparation by matching and subsequent division of an adapted reference image from the x-ray data is described. Finally the algorithm for testing the solder joints for completeness and faint flaws is outlined. A combination between absolute thickness measurement by evaluation of polychromatic intensity distribution of the solder pads and 3D-localization by stereoscopic technics is presented. © 1992 IEEE.},
